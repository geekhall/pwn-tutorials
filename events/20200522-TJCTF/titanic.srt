00:01:51,102 --> 00:01:53,178
(sonar pings)

2
00:01:56,274 --> 00:01:59,440
13 metres. You should see it.

3
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,946
(sonar pings)

4
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:15,665
Okay. Take her up
and over the bow rail.

5
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:20,828
Okay, Mir 2, we're going over the bow.
Stay with us.

6
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,920
(sonar pings)

7
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,816
(mechanical whirring)

8
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:56,121
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.

9
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,041
Seeing her coming out
of the darkness like a ghost ship...

10
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:01,921
..still gets me every time.

11
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:06,798
To see the sad ruin
of the great ship sitting here...

12
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:12,556
..where she landed at 2:30
in the morning of April 15, 1912,...

13
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,806
..after her long fall...

14
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:17,929
..from the world above.

15
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,812
You are so full of shit, boss !

16
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,269
(mechanical whirring)

17
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:26,438
(sonar pinging)

18
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:54,134
Dive six - here we are again
on the deck of Titanic.

19
00:03:54,267 --> 00:04:00,352
2 1/2 miles down, 3,821 meters.

20
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,855
The pressure outside
is 3 1/2 tons per square inch.

21
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,351
These windows are nine inches thick.

22
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:10,443
lf they go,
it's sayonara in two microseconds.

23
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:13,238
All right. Enough of that bullshit.

24
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:30,335
Put her down on the roof
of the officers' quarters.

25
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:31,674
Sure.

26
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:33,470
Okay, Mir 2.

27
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:37,554
We've landed on the grand staircase.
You guys set to launch ?

28
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:40,313
Yeah. Launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.

29
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,561
- Tether out.
- Tether out.

30
00:04:50,656 --> 00:04:54,820
Okay, Brock,
we're dropping down along the hull.

31
00:04:55,995 --> 00:05:00,704
Roger that. Okay, drop down and go
into the first-class gangway door.

32
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:04,920
l want you guys working the ''D'' deck,
reception and the dining saloon.

33
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,913
Copy that.

34
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:14,845
- Tether out.
- Tether out.

35
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:17,054
- Now left.
- l'm coming left.

36
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:27,103
(Brock) Snoop Dog is on the move.

37
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,684
We're headed down the stairwell.

38
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:33,814
Okay, Lewis. Drop down to ''B'' deck.

39
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,188
Okay. ''A'' deck.

40
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,360
(Lewis) Give me some rope, Captain.

41
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:38,484
''B'' deck. Get in there.

42
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:19,068
(Brock) Watch the doorframe.

43
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:20,953
l see it. l got it.

44
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:22,533
(banging)

45
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:24,581
(mechanical whirring)

46
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,327
(cracking)

47
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:28,376
We're good... Just chill, boss.

48
00:06:42,727 --> 00:06:44,636
(Brock) Make your turn.

49
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:47,849
- (Lewis) Cable out, Captain.
- Make your turn.

50
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,348
Brock, we're at the piano.
You copy ?

51
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,519
(Brock) Okay, copy that.

52
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:02,240
(Brock) Right there, that's it !

53
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,533
- That's the bedroom door !
- l see it... l see it.

54
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:15,628
We're in !

55
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:18,553
We're in, baby, we're there !

56
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,010
(Brock) That's Hockley's bed.

57
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:23,768
That's where the son of a bitch slept.

58
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:31,942
(Lewis) Somebody left the water running.

59
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:34,695
Hold it. Go back to the right.

60
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,578
That wardrobe door... Get closer.

61
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:47,114
- You smelling something, boss ?
- l wanna see what's under it.

62
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,702
Gimme my hands, man.

63
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:50,252
(mechanical whirring)

64
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,750
All right... !

65
00:07:57,301 --> 00:08:01,050
- Take it easy. lt might come apart.
- Okay.

66
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:02,419
Go ! Go, go, go !

67
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,554
Flip it over, flip it over. Go.

68
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:07,394
Keep going. Go, go, go.

69
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:08,676
Okay. Drop it.

70
00:08:17,572 --> 00:08:21,071
Oh, baby, baby...
Are you seeing this, boss ?

71
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:25,237
lt's payday, boys.

72
00:08:37,592 --> 00:08:39,668
(cheering)

73
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:43,464
Ka-ching !

74
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,264
We did it, Bobby !

75
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:48,434
(Lewis) Oh, yeah ! Who's the man !

76
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,393
Who's the best, baby ?

77
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,938
Say it, say it.

78
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:53,980
You are, Lewis.

79
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,225
(loud buzzing)

80
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,358
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Right here.

81
00:08:58,446 --> 00:09:00,522
(cheering)

82
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,070
Okay, crack her open.

83
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:14,080
- Let me get around. Hang on.
- You getting it ?

84
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:39,651
Shit.

85
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:42,112
No diamond.

86
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:44,155
You know, boss,...

87
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:49,449
..the same thing happened to Geraldo,
and his career never recovered.

88
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,330
Turn the camera off.

89
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:57,747
Brock, the partners would
like to know how it's going.

90
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,788
Hey, Dave. Barry. Hi.
Look, it wasn't in the safe, but hey...

91
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:05,929
..don't worry about it.
There's plenty of places it could be.

92
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:08,172
The floor debris,
the mother's room...

93
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:10,757
- Purser's safe on ''C'' deck.
- Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.

94
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:12,560
(Brock) A dozen other places.

95
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,979
You've got to trust my instincts.
l know we're close.

96
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:19,648
We just got to go through
a process of elimination.

97
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:21,811
Hang on a second.

98
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:25,941
Let me see that.

99
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,949
We might have something here, guys.

100
00:10:29,537 --> 00:10:32,242
Where's the photo of the necklace ?

101
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,041
- We'll call you right back.
- Holy...

102
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,087
l'll be goddamned.

103
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:53,217
(TV)
{y:i}Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
{y:i}is best known for finding Spanish gold...

104
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,265
lt's okay. l'll feed you in a minute.

105
00:10:56,355 --> 00:11:01,563
{y:i}He's chartered a Russian sub to reach
{y:i}the most famous wreck of all: Titanic.

106
00:11:01,652 --> 00:11:05,816
{y:i}He's with us live via satellite from
{y:i}the Keldysh in the North Atlantic.

107
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:08,528
{y:i}-Hello, Brock.
{y:i}-Hello, Tracy.

108
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:11,535
{y:i}Everyone knows
{y:i}the stories of Titanic,...

109
00:11:11,621 --> 00:11:15,037
{y:i}..the nobility,
{y:i}the band playing and all that.

110
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:19,585
{y:i}l'm interested in the untold stories,
{y:i}the secrets deep inside the hull.

111
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,751
{y:i}We're using robot technology
{y:i}to go further into the wreck...

112
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:25,881
{y:i}..than anybody's ever done before.

113
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:29,254
{y:i}You're at the centre of a controversy...

114
00:11:29,347 --> 00:11:33,475
{y:i}..over salvage rights, and ethics.
{y:i}Many are calling you a grave robber.

115
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,015
{y:i}Nobody called the recovery
{y:i}of King Tut ''grave robbing''.

116
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:38,855
- What is it ?
- Turn that up, dear.

117
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,810
{y:i}l have museum-trained experts here...

118
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,570
{y:i}..making sure these relics
{y:i}are treated properly.

119
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:47,738
{y:i}Look at this drawing
{y:i}we found just today.

120
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:51,489
{y:i}A piece of paper that's been
{y:i}underwater for 84 years...

121
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,361
{y:i}..and my team were able
{y:i}to preserve it intact.

122
00:11:55,456 --> 00:12:00,533
{y:i}Should this have remained unseen
{y:i}at the bottom of the ocean for eternity ?

123
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:02,206
l'll be goddamned.

124
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:08,342
Brock !
There's a satellite call for you.

125
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:12,425
Bobby, we're launching.
You see these submersibles going in ?

126
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:15,184
Trust me, buddy.
You wanna take this call.

127
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:18,517
This better be good.

128
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,689
You gotta speak up.
She's kinda old.

129
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,601
Great.

130
00:12:23,693 --> 00:12:26,896
This is Brock Lovett.
How can l help you, Mrs... ?

131
00:12:26,988 --> 00:12:29,194
Calvert. Rose Calvert.

132
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,155
Mrs Calvert ?

133
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:36,616
l was just wondering if you'd found
the ''Heart of the Ocean'', Mr Lovett.

134
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:40,699
l said you wanted to take the call.

135
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:45,375
All right.
You have my attention, Rose.

136
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,501
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is ?

137
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,170
Oh, yes.

138
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:52,966
The woman in the picture is me.

139
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:13,280
She's a goddamned liar ! Some nutcase
seeking money or publicity !

140
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:17,235
God only knows why !
Like that Russian babe, Anaesthesia !

141
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,406
They're inbound !

142
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:27,793
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on Titanic
when she was 17.

143
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:29,210
Right.

144
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,873
lf she'd lived, she'd be over 100 by now.

145
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:34,377
101 next month.

146
00:13:34,472 --> 00:13:37,508
So she's a very old goddamned liar !

147
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,554
l've done the background
on this woman...

148
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:44,227
..back to the '20s
when she was working as an actress.

149
00:13:44,315 --> 00:13:45,809
An actress !

150
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,028
There's your first clue, Sherlock !
Her name was Rose Dawson back then.

151
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:55,569
She marries a guy named Calvert.
They move to Cedar Rapids and have kids.

152
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,696
Now Calvert's dead,
and Cedar Rapids, too.

153
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,540
Everybody who knows
about the diamond...

154
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:03,617
..is supposed to be dead
or on this boat, but she knows.

155
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:19,598
Doesn't exactly travel light,
does she ?

156
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:23,761
Mrs Calvert, l'm Brock Lovett.

157
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:25,931
Welcome to the Keldysh.

158
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:29,482
Let's get her inside.

159
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:30,902
Hi, Ms Calvert.

160
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:33,275
- Hi.
- Welcome to the Keldysh.

161
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,741
(Man) Hey.

162
00:14:36,826 --> 00:14:38,486
Hey !

163
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,742
(knocking)

164
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:45,823
Yes ?

165
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:48,831
- Are your staterooms all right ?
- Very nice.

166
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,006
Have you met my granddaughter Lizzy ?

167
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,131
She takes care of me.

168
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:56,840
We metjust a few minutes ago.

169
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,467
Remember, Nana ? Up on deck ?

170
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:02,095
(Rose) There, that's nice.

171
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,889
Have to have my pictures when l travel.

172
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:07,552
ls there anything you'd like ?

173
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,727
Yes.

174
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:13,440
l would like to see my drawing.

175
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:31,582
(Brock) Louis XVl wore a fabulous stone,
the Blue Diamond of the Crown,...

176
00:15:31,672 --> 00:15:34,709
..which disappeared in 1792.

177
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:38,585
About that time old Louis
lost everything, from the neck up.

178
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,306
The theory goes that
the Crown Diamond was chopped, too.

179
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:47,639
Recut into a heart shape that became
known as ''The Heart of the Ocean''.

180
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:50,102
Today it'd be worth more
than the Hope Diamond.

181
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:52,599
lt was a dreadful, heavy thing.

182
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,564
l only wore it this once.

183
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,943
You actually think this is you, Nana ?

184
00:15:58,032 --> 00:15:59,989
lt is me, dear.

185
00:16:00,076 --> 00:16:02,152
Wasn't l a dish ?

186
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:06,414
l tracked it down
through insurance records.

187
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:10,283
An old claim that was settled
under terms of absolute secrecy.

188
00:16:10,378 --> 00:16:14,791
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose ?

189
00:16:14,882 --> 00:16:17,089
l imagine someone named Hockley.

190
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,501
Nathan Hockley, that's right.

191
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:21,635
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

192
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:26,717
The claim was for a necklace his son
Caledon bought his fianc閑 - you -

193
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:29,765
..a week before he sailed on Titanic.

194
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:32,726
lt was filed right after the sinking,...

195
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:37,146
..so the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

196
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:40,732
You see the date ?

197
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,448
''April 14, 1912.''

198
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,027
lf your grandmother
is who she says she is,...

199
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:49,123
..she was wearing the diamond
the day the Titanic sank.

200
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:52,708
And that makes you my new best friend.

201
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:57,422
These are some of the things
we recovered from your stateroom.

202
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:01,503
This was mine !

203
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:04,344
How extraordinary !

204
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:08,595
And it looks the same as it did
the last time l saw it.

205
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:16,683
The reflection has changed a bit.

206
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,993
Are you ready to go back to Titanic ?

207
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:43,928
Okay, here we go. She hits the berg
on the starboard side, right ?

208
00:17:44,013 --> 00:17:48,924
She bumps along, punching holes
along the side, below the waterline.

209
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:52,767
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

210
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:56,105
As the water rises, it spills over
the watertight bulkheads...

211
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:58,897
..which don't go any higher
than ''E'' deck.

212
00:17:58,986 --> 00:18:02,854
So now as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up,...

213
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,404
..slow at first,
then faster and faster,...

214
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:09,076
..until she's got her whole ass
up in the air. A big ass.

215
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:12,828
We're talking 20,000, 30,000 tons, okay ?

216
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:17,164
The hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure, so what happens ?

217
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:22,711
She splits, right down to the keel,
and the stern falls back level.

218
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,672
As the bow sinks
it pulls the stern vertical...

219
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:28,088
..and then finally detaches.

220
00:18:28,182 --> 00:18:32,809
The stern section bobs there
like a cork for a few minutes,...

221
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:35,565
..floods, and finally goes under
about 2.20am.

222
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:39,183
Two hours and 40 minutes
after the collision.

223
00:18:39,277 --> 00:18:43,986
The bow section planes away,
landing about half a mile away,...

224
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:47,240
..going 20, 30 knots
when it hits the ocean floor.

225
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:51,739
Pretty cool, huh ?

226
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:57,170
Thank you for that fine
forensic analysis, Mr Bodine.

227
00:18:57,253 --> 00:19:03,126
Of course, the experience of it was...
somewhat different.

228
00:19:03,217 --> 00:19:05,755
Will you share it with us ?

229
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,890
- l'm taking her to rest.
- No.

230
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:05,061
- Come on, Nana.
- No !

231
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:11,735
Tape recorder.

232
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,197
Tell us, Rose.

233
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,414
lt's been 84 years.

234
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:21,494
Try to remember anything.

235
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,165
Anything at all.

236
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:27,040
Do you want to hear this or not,
Mr Lovett ?

237
00:20:31,222 --> 00:20:34,342
lt's been 84 years...

238
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,849
..and l can still smell the fresh paint.

239
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,645
The china had never been used.

240
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:47,142
The sheets had never been slept in.

241
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:52,316
Titanic was called
''The Ship of Dreams''.

242
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,363
And it was.

243
00:20:56,497 --> 00:20:58,573
lt really was.

244
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,863
All third-class passengers...

245
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:32,070
..with a forward berth,...

246
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:35,361
..this way, please.
This queue. Right here.

247
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:36,733
Big boat, uh ?

248
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,154
- Daddy, it's a ship.
- You're right.

249
00:21:39,248 --> 00:21:41,324
(car horn)

250
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:14,447
Why all the fuss ? lt doesn't look
any bigger than the Mauretania.

251
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:18,531
You can be blas?about some things,
Rose, but not about Titanic.

252
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:20,281
lt's 100 feet longer...

253
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,412
..and far more luxurious.

254
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:25,536
Your daughter is difficult
to impress, Ruth.

255
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:28,629
So this is the ship
they say is unsinkable.

256
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,384
God himself could not sink this ship.

257
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:35,216
Sir, you have to check your baggage
through the main terminal.

258
00:22:35,304 --> 00:22:38,673
l put my faith in you, good sir.
Now kindly see my man.

259
00:22:38,766 --> 00:22:40,806
Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir.

260
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,091
Right.

261
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,938
All the trunks from that car there,...

262
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:48,391
..12 from here, and the safe,...

263
00:22:48,484 --> 00:22:51,355
..to the Parlour Suite, rooms B52, 54, 56.

264
00:22:51,445 --> 00:22:52,904
(whistle)

265
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:55,028
Ladies...

266
00:22:55,116 --> 00:22:56,824
Better hurry.

267
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:04,363
- My coat ?
- l have it, miss.

268
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:10,621
All third-class passengers
queue here for health inspection.

269
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:12,090
Chin up.

270
00:23:17,013 --> 00:23:20,927
Welcome aboard, ma'am.
Welcome to Titanic.

271
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:24,552
(Rose)
{y:i}lt was the ship of dreams
{y:i}-to everyone else.

272
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,191
{y:i}To me it was a slave ship...

273
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:32,023
{y:i}..taking me back to America in chains.

274
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:36,654
{y:i}Outwardly l was everything
{y:i}a well-brought-up girl should be.

275
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:39,148
{y:i}lnside, l was screaming.

276
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:41,035
(steam whistle)

277
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,040
(speaking Swedish)

278
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:58,753
Jack, you are pazzo.
You bet everything we have.

279
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:02,096
When you got nothing,
you got nothing to lose.

280
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:08,393
(Swedish) You moron.
l can't believe you bet our tickets.

281
00:24:09,232 --> 00:24:10,263
Sven ?

282
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,542
All right... moment of truth.

283
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:37,545
Somebody's life's about to change.

284
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:38,631
Fabrizio ?

285
00:24:40,721 --> 00:24:41,753
Niente.

286
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:42,885
Niente.

287
00:24:44,433 --> 00:24:46,093
Olaf ?

288
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:47,508
Nothing.

289
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:49,263
Sven ?

290
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:54,354
Uh-oh. Two pair.

291
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:56,608
l'm sorry, Fabrizio.

292
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:59,068
''Sorry'' ? You bet all the money !

293
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:03,024
l'm sorry. You're not gonna see
your mom for a long time.

294
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,535
Cos we're going to America !
Full house, boys !

295
00:25:06,622 --> 00:25:08,200
Whoa !

296
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,619
Yeah !

297
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:11,832
Dio mio, grazie !

298
00:25:13,504 --> 00:25:15,912
(cursing in Swedish)

299
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:21,003
Come on !

300
00:25:21,095 --> 00:25:22,340
Figlio di puttana !

301
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,173
l'm going home !

302
00:25:24,265 --> 00:25:26,341
(cursing in Swedish)

303
00:25:27,018 --> 00:25:28,263
l'm going home !

304
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,392
l go to America !

305
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,678
No, mate.

306
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:34,608
Titanic go to America, in five minutes.

307
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:38,232
Come on ! Come on, here !

308
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:40,479
Andiamo !

309
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:44,405
We're riding in high style now !
We're a couple of swells !

310
00:25:44,494 --> 00:25:47,411
Practically goddamn royalty,
ragazzo mio !

311
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:50,533
You see, it's my destino !

312
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,116
l go to America to be millionario !

313
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:54,835
(Driver) Whoa ! Whoa !

314
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,581
Bastardo !

315
00:25:56,672 --> 00:26:00,966
- You're pazzo !
- Maybe, but l've got the tickets !

316
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:03,341
Come on, l thought you were fast !

317
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:07,641
- Aspetta !
- Wait ! Hey, wait !

318
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:10,216
We're passengers ! Passengers !

319
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:14,519
- Have you been through the inspection ?
- Of course !

320
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:17,561
Anyway, we don't have lice.
We're Americans.

321
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:20,569
Right. Come aboard.

322
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:26,866
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world !

323
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:29,783
(ship's horn)

324
00:26:35,253 --> 00:26:36,961
Goodbye !

325
00:26:41,175 --> 00:26:43,845
- You know somebody ?
- That's not the point.

326
00:26:43,928 --> 00:26:48,590
- Goodbye ! l'll miss you !
- Goodbye ! l will never forget you !

327
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,931
(crowd cheering)

328
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:39,224
Go left, darling.

329
00:27:44,113 --> 00:27:45,940
G60, G60...

330
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:48,108
Excuse me, ma'am.

331
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,445
Oh, right here.

332
00:27:52,747 --> 00:27:56,116
Hey, how you doing ?
Jack. Nice to meet you.

333
00:27:56,209 --> 00:28:00,123
l'm Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.
How you doing ?

334
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:02,786
Who says you get top bunk, huh ?

335
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,506
(Swedish) Where's Sven ?

336
00:28:06,594 --> 00:28:12,015
This is your private deck, sir.
Would you be requiring anything ?

337
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:14,092
- Mm-mm.
- Excuse me.

338
00:28:14,185 --> 00:28:18,894
- This one ?
- No... lt had a lot of faces on it.

339
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:21,057
This is the one.

340
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:24,278
Would you like all of them out, miss ?

341
00:28:24,362 --> 00:28:27,565
Yes... We need a little colour
in this room.

342
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:32,530
Put it in there, in the wardrobe.

343
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,621
God, not those finger paintings again !

344
00:28:35,706 --> 00:28:37,165
Waste of money !

345
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,373
The difference between Cal's taste
and mine...

346
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,295
..is that l have some.
They're fascinating.

347
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,630
Like being inside a dream
or something.

348
00:28:45,716 --> 00:28:47,590
There's truth, but no logic.

349
00:28:47,677 --> 00:28:50,761
- What's the artist's name ?
- Something Picasso.

350
00:28:50,847 --> 00:28:54,927
''Something Picasso''.
He won't amount to a thing. Trust me.

351
00:28:55,017 --> 00:28:58,718
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least they were cheap.

352
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:00,889
Put it in the wardrobe.

353
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:09,739
(Rose)
{y:i}At Cherbourg, a woman
{y:i}came aboard named Margaret Brown.

354
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:11,816
{y:i}We all called her Molly.

355
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:15,954
{y:i}History would call her
''{y:i}The Unsinkable Molly Brown''.

356
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:20,617
l wasn't about to wait all day, sonny.
Here, think you can manage ?

357
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:24,293
{y:i}Her husband had struck gold
{y:i}someplace out west...

358
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,714
{y:i}..and she was what Mother called
''{y:i}new money''.

359
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,177
{y:i}By next afternoon we were steaming
{y:i}west from the coast of lreland...

360
00:29:32,263 --> 00:29:36,427
{y:i}..with nothing out ahead of us but ocean.

361
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,857
Take her to sea, Mr Murdoch.

362
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:48,980
- Let's stretch her legs.
- Yes, sir.

363
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:54,110
- All ahead full, Mr Moody.
- Very good, sir.

364
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:56,445
(bells ringing)

365
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,070
All ahead full.

366
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:02,408
(Man) All ahead full !

367
00:30:02,502 --> 00:30:04,578
Come on, lads. Step lively.

368
00:30:22,855 --> 00:30:26,355
Let's stoke them right up !
We're going full ahead !

369
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:25,033
21 knots, sir.

370
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:36,012
Hey, look, look, look !
Look, look !

371
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:39,842
See it ?

372
00:31:43,144 --> 00:31:45,302
There's another one ! See him ?

373
00:31:55,072 --> 00:31:56,864
Look at that one !

374
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:58,942
Look at him jump !

375
00:31:59,035 --> 00:31:59,781
Whoo-hoo !

376
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,390
Whoo !

377
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:26,729
l can see the Statue of Liberty
already !

378
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:28,639
Very small, of course.

379
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:35,106
l'm the king of the world !

380
00:32:35,196 --> 00:32:36,939
(whooping and yelling)

381
00:33:20,783 --> 00:33:23,618
She is the largest moving object
ever made by the hand of man...

382
00:33:23,703 --> 00:33:25,576
..in all history.

383
00:33:25,663 --> 00:33:28,747
Our master shipbuilder,
Mr Andrews,...

384
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,375
..designed her.

385
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,333
l knocked her together...

386
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,911
..but the idea was Mr lsmay's.

387
00:33:35,006 --> 00:33:38,422
He envisioned a steamer
so grand in scale...

388
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:41,843
..that its supremacy
would never be challenged.

389
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:43,507
And here she is...

390
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:45,756
..willed into solid reality.

391
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,843
Hear, hear.

392
00:33:47,935 --> 00:33:49,928
Salmon.

393
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:56,564
You know l don't like that, Rose.

394
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,730
She knows.

395
00:34:02,116 --> 00:34:06,743
We'll both have the lamb, rare,
with very little mint sauce.

396
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:09,403
You like lamb, right, sweet pea ?

397
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:14,287
Are you gonna cut her meat
for her, too, Cal ?

398
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:21,420
Hey, who thought of the name
''Titanic'' ? Was it you, Bruce ?

399
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:23,053
Yes, actually.

400
00:34:23,137 --> 00:34:28,048
l wanted to convey sheer size,
and the size means stability,...

401
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:32,270
..luxury, and, above all, strength.

402
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:34,893
Do you know of Dr Freud, Mr lsmay ?

403
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:39,443
His ideas about male preoccupation
with size might interest you.

404
00:34:40,822 --> 00:34:44,356
- What's gotten into you ?
- Excuse me.

405
00:34:47,662 --> 00:34:49,654
l do apologise.

406
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:52,037
She's a pistol, Cal.
Hope you can handle her.

407
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:56,621
Well, l may have to start minding
what she reads, Mrs Brown.

408
00:34:56,712 --> 00:35:00,212
Freud... who is he ?
ls he a passenger ?

409
00:35:01,342 --> 00:35:04,509
..turns the propeller,...

410
00:35:04,595 --> 00:35:06,671
..makes these waves,...

411
00:35:07,265 --> 00:35:09,341
..makes them spin.

412
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:15,016
(Fabrizio) The ship is nice, uh ?

413
00:35:15,106 --> 00:35:18,142
- Yeah, it's an lrish ship.
- ls English, no ?

414
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:22,777
No, it was built in lreland.
15,000 lrishmen built this ship.

415
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:24,524
That's typical.

416
00:35:24,615 --> 00:35:28,483
First-class dogs come down here
to take a shite.

417
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:30,617
lt lets us know where we rank.

418
00:35:30,705 --> 00:35:32,781
Like we could forget ?

419
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,372
l'm Tommy Ryan.

420
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,832
- Jack Dawson.
- Fabrizio.

421
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,167
Hi. Do you make any money
with your drawings ?

422
00:35:51,142 --> 00:35:56,433
Oh, forget it, boyo. You'd as like
have angels fly out of your arse...

423
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:59,013
..as get next to the likes of her.

424
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:25,751
(Rose)
{y:i}l saw my whole life
{y:i}as if l'd already lived it,...

425
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:29,675
{y:i}..an endless parade of parties
{y:i}and cotillions,...

426
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:31,840
{y:i}..yachts and polo matches.

427
00:36:32,642 --> 00:36:37,553
{y:i}Always the same narrow people,
{y:i}the same mindless chatter.

428
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:41,775
{y:i}l felt like l was standing
{y:i}at a great precipice...

429
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:44,529
{y:i}..with no-one to pull me back.

430
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:48,941
{y:i}No-one who cared, or even noticed.

431
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:58,992
(Rose sobbing)

432
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:21,348
(Rose running and sobbing)

433
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:39,893
Don't do it.

434
00:38:39,977 --> 00:38:41,970
Stay back.

435
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:44,269
Don't come any closer.

436
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:47,105
Come on.

437
00:38:47,193 --> 00:38:50,229
- Gimme your hand. l'll pull you back.
- No !

438
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:52,693
Stay where you are. l mean it.

439
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:55,775
l'll let go.

440
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:07,412
No, you won't.

441
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:11,335
What do you mean, no, l won't ?

442
00:39:11,425 --> 00:39:15,174
Don't presume to tell me
what l will and will not do.

443
00:39:15,263 --> 00:39:17,302
Well, you would've done it already.

444
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,963
You're distracting me. Go away.

445
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:21,601
l can't.

446
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:24,011
l'm involved now.

447
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:28,055
You let go and l'm gonna
have to jump in there after you.

448
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:32,189
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.

449
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,064
- l'm a good swimmer.
- The fall alone would kill you.

450
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,610
lt would hurt.
l'm not saying it wouldn't.

451
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:43,832
But l'm more concerned
about that water being so cold.

452
00:39:50,173 --> 00:39:52,046
How cold ?

453
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:55,584
Freezing.
Maybe a couple of degrees over.

454
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:01,303
You ever, uh...

455
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:03,717
..ever been to Wisconsin ?

456
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,606
What ?

457
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,181
They have some of the coldest winters.

458
00:40:10,276 --> 00:40:13,443
l grew up there, near Chippewa Falls.

459
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:17,444
When l was a kid,
me and my father went ice fishing...

460
00:40:17,533 --> 00:40:19,490
..out on Lake Wissota.

461
00:40:19,577 --> 00:40:21,534
lce fishing is where you...

462
00:40:21,621 --> 00:40:23,946
l know what ice fishing is !

463
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,914
Sorry.

464
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:30,875
You just seem like, you know,
kind of an indoor girl.

465
00:40:32,757 --> 00:40:34,999
Anyway, l, uh...

466
00:40:35,092 --> 00:40:37,465
l fell through some thin ice.

467
00:40:37,553 --> 00:40:40,258
And l'm telling you...

468
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:43,681
..water that cold,
like right down there,...

469
00:40:43,768 --> 00:40:47,812
..it hits you like a thousand knives
stabbing you all over.

470
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:50,602
You can't breathe...

471
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,685
You can't think...

472
00:40:53,778 --> 00:40:56,447
At least not about anything
but the pain.

473
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:02,866
Which is why l'm not looking forward
to jumping in there after you.

474
00:41:02,954 --> 00:41:04,614
Like l said,...

475
00:41:06,457 --> 00:41:08,533
..l don't have a choice.

476
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:17,213
l'm hoping you'll come back
over the rail and get me off the hook here.

477
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:19,377
You're crazy.

478
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:22,598
That's what everybody says, but...

479
00:41:23,182 --> 00:41:28,473
With all due respect, miss, l'm not the one
hanging off the back of a ship.

480
00:41:28,563 --> 00:41:30,602
Come on.

481
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:33,525
Come on, gimme your hand.

482
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:36,563
You don't wanna do this.

483
00:41:48,624 --> 00:41:50,284
Whew !

484
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,749
l'm Jack Dawson.

485
00:41:52,837 --> 00:41:54,794
Rose DeWitt Bukater.

486
00:41:54,881 --> 00:41:57,550
l'll have to get you
to write that down !

487
00:41:59,802 --> 00:42:01,427
Come on.

488
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:05,217
(screams)

489
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,351
l got you ! Come on !

490
00:42:09,437 --> 00:42:11,476
Come on !

491
00:42:13,524 --> 00:42:14,983
(screams)

492
00:42:15,067 --> 00:42:16,478
Help ! Please !

493
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:18,645
Help ! Please !

494
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:22,617
- Please help me !
- Listen ! Listen to me !

495
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,443
l've got you. l won't let go.

496
00:42:24,535 --> 00:42:26,824
Now pull yourself up. Come on !

497
00:42:29,499 --> 00:42:30,447
Come on.

498
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,042
That's right.

499
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:34,617
You can do it.

500
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:40,091
l got you.

501
00:42:45,056 --> 00:42:48,140
What's all this ?

502
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,480
You stand back !
And don't move an inch !

503
00:42:57,443 --> 00:42:59,483
Fetch the master-at-arms !

504
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,610
Care for a brandy ?

505
00:43:01,697 --> 00:43:04,449
(Cal) This is completely unacceptable !

506
00:43:04,534 --> 00:43:07,903
How dare you put your hands
on my fianc閑 !

507
00:43:07,995 --> 00:43:10,321
- Look at me, you filth !
- Cal...

508
00:43:10,414 --> 00:43:14,958
- What do you think you were doing ?
- Cal, stop ! lt was an accident.

509
00:43:15,044 --> 00:43:17,001
An accident ?

510
00:43:17,088 --> 00:43:18,582
lt was.

511
00:43:18,673 --> 00:43:20,831
Stupid, really.

512
00:43:20,925 --> 00:43:24,128
l was leaning over and l slipped.

513
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,306
l was leaning far over to see the, uh...

514
00:43:30,393 --> 00:43:31,804
..uh...

515
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:32,926
..the, uh...

516
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,105
- Propellers ?
- Propellers. And l slipped.

517
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:40,520
l would have gone overboard,
but Mr Dawson here saved me...

518
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:43,316
..and almost went over himself.

519
00:43:43,406 --> 00:43:47,984
- She wanted to see the propellers !
- Women and machinery do not mix.

520
00:43:48,077 --> 00:43:51,411
Was that the way of it ?

521
00:43:52,748 --> 00:43:55,370
Yeah. Yeah, that was pretty much it.

522
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,208
The boy's a hero, then.
Good for you, son. Well done.

523
00:43:59,297 --> 00:44:01,455
So it's all's well, and, uh...

524
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:03,588
..back to our brandy, eh ?

525
00:44:03,676 --> 00:44:07,840
Look at you. You must be freezing.
Let's get you inside.

526
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,468
Perhaps a little something for the boy ?

527
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:13,977
Of course.

528
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:17,181
Mr Lovejoy, l think a 20 should do it.

529
00:44:17,315 --> 00:44:21,063
ls that the going rate
for saving the woman you love ?

530
00:44:22,737 --> 00:44:25,524
Rose is displeased. What to do...

531
00:44:26,824 --> 00:44:28,105
l know.

532
00:44:30,036 --> 00:44:34,283
Perhaps you could join us
for dinner tomorrow evening...

533
00:44:34,373 --> 00:44:37,956
..to regale our group with...
your heroic tale.

534
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:42,921
Sure. Count me in.

535
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:46,043
Good. Settled, then.

536
00:44:46,135 --> 00:44:49,385
- This should be interesting.
- Mmm.

537
00:44:53,392 --> 00:44:54,507
(whistles)

538
00:44:57,313 --> 00:44:59,804
Can l, uh... bum a smoke ?

539
00:45:07,573 --> 00:45:09,945
You'll want to tie those.

540
00:45:12,495 --> 00:45:14,119
lt's interesting.

541
00:45:14,205 --> 00:45:16,660
The young lady slips so suddenly...

542
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:21,625
..and you still had time to remove
your jacket and your shoes.

543
00:45:26,467 --> 00:45:28,009
(music box)

544
00:45:28,052 --> 00:45:29,677
(knock at door)

545
00:45:35,935 --> 00:45:38,224
l know you've been melancholy.

546
00:45:39,105 --> 00:45:41,181
l don't pretend to know why.

547
00:45:43,734 --> 00:45:45,941
l intended to save this...

548
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:49,113
..until the engagement gala...

549
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:51,775
..next week.

550
00:45:52,243 --> 00:45:54,699
But... l thought...

551
00:45:54,787 --> 00:45:56,447
..tonight.

552
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,616
Good gracious !

553
00:45:59,709 --> 00:46:01,832
A reminder of my feelings for you.

554
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:03,248
ls it a... ?

555
00:46:03,337 --> 00:46:05,164
Diamond ? Yes.

556
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:09,709
56 carats to be exact.

557
00:46:12,722 --> 00:46:18,475
lt was worn by Louis XVl,
and they called it ''Le Coeur de la Mer''.

558
00:46:18,561 --> 00:46:21,266
(Both) The Heart of the Ocean.

559
00:46:26,861 --> 00:46:28,900
lt's overwhelming.

560
00:46:28,988 --> 00:46:31,064
Well, it's for royalty.

561
00:46:32,033 --> 00:46:34,109
We are royalty, Rose.

562
00:46:37,663 --> 00:46:41,282
You know, there's nothing
l couldn't give you.

563
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:44,163
There's nothing l'd deny you...

564
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,161
..if you would not deny me.

565
00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:52,385
Oh, open your heart to me, Rose.

566
00:47:08,402 --> 00:47:13,195
(Jack) Well, l've been on my own
since l was 15, since my folks died.

567
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:17,410
l had no close kin
in that part of the country.

568
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:20,698
So l left and l haven't been back since.

569
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,953
You could just call me a tumbleweed
blowing in the wind.

570
00:47:25,419 --> 00:47:29,880
Well, Rose, we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck...

571
00:47:29,966 --> 00:47:34,462
..and chewed over how great
the weather's been and how l grew up,...

572
00:47:34,554 --> 00:47:39,132
..but l reckon that's not
why you came to talk to me, is it ?

573
00:47:39,225 --> 00:47:42,060
- Mr Dawson, l...
- Jack.

574
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:43,687
Jack.

575
00:47:43,771 --> 00:47:46,345
l want to thank you for what you did.

576
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:51,687
Notjust for... for pulling me back,
but for your discretion.

577
00:47:51,779 --> 00:47:53,571
You're welcome.

578
00:47:53,656 --> 00:47:57,523
Look, l know what
you must be thinking.

579
00:47:58,953 --> 00:48:00,993
Poor little rich girl.

580
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,488
What does she know about misery ?

581
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:06,537
No... No, that's not what l was thinking.

582
00:48:06,627 --> 00:48:10,376
l was thinking
what could have happened to this girl...

583
00:48:10,465 --> 00:48:13,216
..to make her think she had no way out.

584
00:48:15,094 --> 00:48:16,968
Well, l...

585
00:48:17,388 --> 00:48:20,887
lt was everything.
lt was my whole world...

586
00:48:20,975 --> 00:48:22,968
..and all the people in it.

587
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:27,853
The inertia of my life... plunging
ahead, and me powerless to stop it.

588
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,396
God ! Look at that thing !

589
00:48:30,485 --> 00:48:33,439
You would've gone
straight to the bottom.

590
00:48:33,529 --> 00:48:36,234
500 invitations have gone out.

591
00:48:36,532 --> 00:48:40,281
All of Philadelphia society
will be there,...

592
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:44,035
..and all the while l feel
l'm standing in a crowded room...

593
00:48:44,123 --> 00:48:47,741
..screaming at the top of my lungs,
and no-one even looks up.

594
00:48:48,419 --> 00:48:50,412
Do you love him ?

595
00:48:51,547 --> 00:48:53,339
Pardon me ?

596
00:48:53,424 --> 00:48:55,500
Do you love him ?

597
00:48:55,593 --> 00:48:58,214
You shouldn't be asking me this.

598
00:48:58,304 --> 00:49:01,139
lt's a simple question.
Do you love the guy or not ?

599
00:49:02,934 --> 00:49:07,228
- This is not a suitable conversation.
- Can't you just answer the question ?

600
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:13,605
This is absurd. You don't know me
and l don't know you,...

601
00:49:13,694 --> 00:49:16,898
..and we are not having this conversation.

602
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:20,489
You are rude and uncouth
and... l am leaving now.

603
00:49:20,576 --> 00:49:23,494
Jack... Mr Dawson,
it's been a pleasure.

604
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:26,070
l sought you out to thank you...

605
00:49:26,165 --> 00:49:29,748
- And you insulted me.
- You deserved it.

606
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:31,912
- Right.
- Right.

607
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,341
- l thought you were leaving.
- l am.

608
00:49:38,511 --> 00:49:40,587
You are so annoying !

609
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,257
Wait.

610
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:46,097
l don't have to leave.
This is my part of the ship.

611
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:48,012
You leave.

612
00:49:48,104 --> 00:49:51,687
Well, well, well !
Now who's being rude ?

613
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:59,024
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around ?

614
00:49:59,157 --> 00:50:02,490
So what are you ?
An artist or something ?

615
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,784
Well... these are rather good.

616
00:50:10,168 --> 00:50:13,619
They're, uh...
they're very good, actually.

617
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:23,800
Jack, this is exquisite work.

618
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,555
- They didn't like them in old Paris.
- Paris ?!

619
00:50:27,643 --> 00:50:31,427
You do get around, for a poor...

620
00:50:32,565 --> 00:50:36,693
Well, uh, uh,
a person of limited means.

621
00:50:36,777 --> 00:50:39,103
A poor guy. You can say it.

622
00:50:42,283 --> 00:50:43,943
Well, well, well !

623
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,702
And these were drawn from life ?

624
00:50:53,127 --> 00:50:55,535
That's the good thing about Paris.

625
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:59,378
Lots of girls
willing to take their clothes off.

626
00:51:03,137 --> 00:51:05,213
You liked this woman.

627
00:51:05,306 --> 00:51:07,927
You used her several times.

628
00:51:09,018 --> 00:51:13,680
Well, she had beautiful hands,
you see ?

629
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:17,106
l think you must have had
a love affair with her.

630
00:51:17,193 --> 00:51:18,224
No, no, no.

631
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:20,644
Just with her hands.

632
00:51:20,738 --> 00:51:23,276
She was a one-legged prostitute.

633
00:51:23,366 --> 00:51:24,908
See ?

634
00:51:28,246 --> 00:51:30,119
Oh !

635
00:51:30,998 --> 00:51:33,952
She had a good sense of humour,
though.

636
00:51:35,878 --> 00:51:37,538
And this lady...

637
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:42,458
She used to sit at this bar
every night...

638
00:51:42,552 --> 00:51:46,715
..wearing all her jewellery,
waiting for her long-lost love.

639
00:51:47,974 --> 00:51:50,180
Called her Madame Bijoux.

640
00:51:50,268 --> 00:51:54,052
See how her clothes
are all moth-eaten ?

641
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:57,147
Well, you have a gift, Jack.

642
00:51:57,233 --> 00:51:58,727
You do.

643
00:51:58,818 --> 00:52:00,229
You see people.

644
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,526
l see you.

645
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,984
And ?

646
00:52:06,075 --> 00:52:08,862
You wouldn't have jumped.

647
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:17,495
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

648
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:19,579
Rose has already done that.

649
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:22,459
Here comes that vulgar Brown woman.

650
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:25,302
Quickly, get up before she sits with us.

651
00:52:25,386 --> 00:52:26,797
Hello, girls.

652
00:52:26,888 --> 00:52:31,051
- l was hoping l'd catch you at tea.
- We're awfully sorry you missed it.

653
00:52:31,142 --> 00:52:33,977
The Countess and l
were just off to the boat deck.

654
00:52:34,061 --> 00:52:37,146
What a lovely idea.
l need to catch up on my gossip.

655
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:42,191
Countess.

656
00:52:43,446 --> 00:52:46,696
So you've not yet lit
the last four boilers ?

657
00:52:46,782 --> 00:52:50,033
l don't see the need.
We are making excellent time.

658
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:52,789
The press knows the size of Titanic.

659
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:56,242
Now l want them to marvel at her speed.

660
00:52:56,334 --> 00:52:59,453
We must give them
something new to print.

661
00:53:00,129 --> 00:53:02,667
This maiden voyage of Titanic...

662
00:53:02,757 --> 00:53:04,749
..must make headlines.

663
00:53:04,842 --> 00:53:08,674
Mr lsmay, l would prefer
not to push the engines...

664
00:53:08,763 --> 00:53:11,550
..until they've been properly run in.

665
00:53:11,641 --> 00:53:17,097
Of course, l'm just a passenger.
l leave it to you to decide what's best.

666
00:53:17,188 --> 00:53:21,435
But a glorious end to your final trip
if we arrive on Tuesday night...

667
00:53:21,526 --> 00:53:24,361
..and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.

668
00:53:24,445 --> 00:53:27,019
Retire with a bang, eh, EJ ?

669
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:31,985
Good man.

670
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:36,702
Well, after that l worked
on a squid boat in Monterey.

671
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:39,329
Then l went to the pier
in Santa Monica...

672
00:53:39,418 --> 00:53:43,499
..and started doing portraits there
for 10 cents apiece.

673
00:53:43,548 --> 00:53:47,592
Why can't l be like you, Jack ?
Just head out for the horizon...

674
00:53:47,677 --> 00:53:49,753
..whenever l feel like it.

675
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:53,680
Say we'll go there sometime to that pier...

676
00:53:53,766 --> 00:53:55,889
..even if we only just talk about it.

677
00:53:55,977 --> 00:53:57,601
No, we'll do it.

678
00:53:57,687 --> 00:54:01,020
We'll drink cheap beer.
Ride on the roller coaster.

679
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:04,143
Then we'll ride horses on the beach...

680
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:08,813
..right in the surf. But like a real cowboy.
Not that sidesaddle stuff.

681
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:12,526
You mean, one leg on each side ?

682
00:54:12,618 --> 00:54:14,077
Yeah.

683
00:54:14,162 --> 00:54:17,577
- Can you show me ?
- Sure. lf you like.

684
00:54:18,624 --> 00:54:22,408
- Teach me to ride like a man.
- And chew tobacco like a man.

685
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,205
And spit like a man !

686
00:54:26,299 --> 00:54:28,090
They didn't teach you that ?

687
00:54:28,176 --> 00:54:29,634
No !

688
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:31,758
Come on, l'll show you.

689
00:54:31,846 --> 00:54:34,004
l'll show you how. Come on.

690
00:54:34,098 --> 00:54:36,933
Jack ! No ! Jack ! No !

691
00:54:37,018 --> 00:54:39,176
Wait, Jack. No, Jack.

692
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,639
- l couldn't possibly, Jack.
- Watch closely.

693
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:46,776
- That's disgusting !
- Your turn.

694
00:54:49,405 --> 00:54:50,734
Pitiful !

695
00:54:50,823 --> 00:54:55,450
You really gotta hawk it back.
Use your arms. Arc your neck.

696
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:59,165
See the range on that thing ?

697
00:54:59,248 --> 00:55:01,537
(Jack) Okay, go.

698
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:09,831
You gotta work on it. Really try
and hawk it up and get some body to it.

699
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:11,088
(snorting)

700
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,474
Mother.

701
00:55:24,148 --> 00:55:26,686
May l introduce Jack Dawson ?

702
00:55:26,776 --> 00:55:28,852
Charmed, l'm sure.

703
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:38,819
(Rose)
{y:i}The others were gracious
{y:i}about the man who saved my life...

704
00:55:38,913 --> 00:55:42,993
{y:i}..but my mother looked at him
{y:i}like an insect,...

705
00:55:43,084 --> 00:55:45,373
{y:i}..a dangerous insect,...

706
00:55:45,461 --> 00:55:47,668
{y:i}..which must be squashed quickly.

707
00:55:47,755 --> 00:55:52,382
Sounds like you're a good man
to have around in a sticky spot.

708
00:55:52,468 --> 00:55:54,508
(trumpet playing fanfare)

709
00:55:54,595 --> 00:55:58,260
Why do they always announce dinner
like a damn cavalry charge ?

710
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,676
Shall we go dress, Mother ?

711
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:04,304
See you at dinner, Jack.

712
00:56:05,439 --> 00:56:07,099
Uh, son ?

713
00:56:07,191 --> 00:56:09,184
Son !

714
00:56:09,277 --> 00:56:11,684
Do you have any idea what you're doing ?

715
00:56:11,779 --> 00:56:13,653
Not really.

716
00:56:13,739 --> 00:56:17,274
Well, you're about
to go into the snakepit.

717
00:56:18,077 --> 00:56:20,615
What are you planning to wear ?

718
00:56:22,748 --> 00:56:24,788
l figured.

719
00:56:24,876 --> 00:56:26,915
Come on.

720
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:33,083
l was right ! You and my son
are just about the same size.

721
00:56:33,176 --> 00:56:35,085
Pretty close.

722
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:38,464
(whistles)

723
00:56:38,556 --> 00:56:41,261
You shine up like a new penny !

724
00:56:50,985 --> 00:56:53,061
Good evening, sir.

725
00:57:00,536 --> 00:57:04,700
(orchestra playing
''On the Beautiful Blue Danube'')

726
00:57:44,664 --> 00:57:46,206
Good evening.

727
00:57:52,004 --> 00:57:54,330
Hello.

728
00:57:56,342 --> 00:58:00,589
(Cal) There are several thousand tons
of Hockley steel...

729
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:04,298
..in this very ship.

730
00:58:04,392 --> 00:58:08,520
Then we'll know who to hold
accountable if there's a problem.

731
00:58:08,604 --> 00:58:10,063
There is the Countess.

732
00:58:10,148 --> 00:58:12,187
- Hello, my dear.
- Good evening, Cal.

733
00:58:12,275 --> 00:58:15,110
(Cal) So good to see you.

734
00:58:39,093 --> 00:58:43,387
l saw that in a nickelodeon once
and l always wanted to do it.

735
00:58:55,151 --> 00:58:57,190
(Ruth) l'll see you at dinner.

736
00:58:57,278 --> 00:58:58,393
Darling ?

737
00:58:58,488 --> 00:59:01,275
Surely you remember Mr Dawson ?

738
00:59:01,741 --> 00:59:03,200
Dawson ?

739
00:59:03,284 --> 00:59:08,112
Well, it's amazing !
You could almost pass for a gentleman !

740
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:10,452
Almost.

741
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:12,415
Extraordinary !

742
00:59:23,513 --> 00:59:26,632
(Ruth) My dear, it's delightful to see you.

743
00:59:26,724 --> 00:59:30,223
What a remarkable voyage this is !
Mad, isn't it ?

744
00:59:31,646 --> 00:59:34,018
There's the Countess of Rothes.

745
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:40,645
And, um... that's John Jacob Astor,
the richest man on the ship.

746
00:59:40,738 --> 00:59:45,614
His little wifey, Madeleine,
is my age and in a delicate condition.

747
00:59:45,701 --> 00:59:48,371
See how she's trying to hide it ?

748
00:59:48,454 --> 00:59:50,494
- Quite the scandal.
- Hmm !

749
00:59:50,581 --> 00:59:55,124
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress Madame Aubert.

750
00:59:55,211 --> 00:59:57,832
Mrs Guggenheim is at home
with the children.

751
00:59:57,922 --> 01:00:02,501
And over here we have Sir Cosmo
and Lucille Lady Duff-Gordon.

752
01:00:02,593 --> 01:00:04,882
She designs naughty lingerie.

753
01:00:04,971 --> 01:00:07,047
Very popular with the royals.

754
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,891
Congratulations, Hockley.
She's splendid.

755
01:00:09,976 --> 01:00:11,803
Why, thank you.

756
01:00:11,894 --> 01:00:13,970
Care to escort a lady to dinner ?

757
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:15,641
Certainly.

758
01:00:16,399 --> 01:00:18,391
Sweet pea ?

759
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:19,895
(Cal) Sweet pea !

760
01:00:19,986 --> 01:00:23,271
Ain't nothin' to it, Jack.
They love money,...

761
01:00:23,364 --> 01:00:27,825
..so just pretend like you own
a goldmine and you're in the club.

762
01:00:28,995 --> 01:00:30,868
Hey, Astor !

763
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:34,201
Well, hello, Molly !
Nice to see you.

764
01:00:34,292 --> 01:00:37,162
JJ, Madeleine,
l'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

765
01:00:37,253 --> 01:00:38,664
- How do you do ?
- Pleasure.

766
01:00:38,754 --> 01:00:39,786
Hello, Jack.

767
01:00:39,881 --> 01:00:41,873
Are you of the Boston Dawsons ?

768
01:00:41,966 --> 01:00:45,501
No... the Chippewa Falls Dawsons,
actually.

769
01:00:45,595 --> 01:00:47,338
Oh, yes...

770
01:00:49,432 --> 01:00:54,058
(Rose)
{y:i}He must have been nervous,
{y:i}but he never faltered.

771
01:00:54,145 --> 01:00:56,351
{y:i}They assumed he was one of them.

772
01:00:56,439 --> 01:00:59,191
{y:i}Heir to a railroad fortune, perhaps.

773
01:01:00,193 --> 01:01:04,107
{y:i}New money, obviously,
{y:i}but still a member of the club.

774
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:08,195
{y:i}Mother, of course,
{y:i}could always be counted upon.

775
01:01:08,284 --> 01:01:11,735
Tell us of the accommodations
in steerage, Mr Dawson.

776
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:13,703
l hear they're quite good.

777
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,245
The best l've seen, ma'am.

778
01:01:16,334 --> 01:01:18,373
Hardly any rats.

779
01:01:18,461 --> 01:01:20,537
(laughter)

780
01:01:21,255 --> 01:01:24,505
Mr Dawson is joining us
from the third class.

781
01:01:24,592 --> 01:01:27,676
He was of some assistance
to my fianc閑 last night.

782
01:01:27,762 --> 01:01:30,004
Mr Dawson is quite a fine artist.

783
01:01:30,097 --> 01:01:33,264
He was kind enough to show me
some of his work today.

784
01:01:33,351 --> 01:01:36,435
Rose and l differ somewhat
in our definition of fine art.

785
01:01:36,521 --> 01:01:38,312
Not to impugn your work, sir.

786
01:01:40,024 --> 01:01:41,684
(clears throat)

787
01:01:43,402 --> 01:01:45,858
(lsmay) She may be mine on paper...

788
01:01:45,947 --> 01:01:48,698
..but in the eyes of God
she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

789
01:01:48,783 --> 01:01:50,325
Are these all for me ?

790
01:01:50,409 --> 01:01:52,983
Start from the outside
and work your way in.

791
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:57,207
- He knows every rivet in her.
- Your ship is a wonder, Mr Andrews.

792
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,834
Thank you, Rose.

793
01:02:01,671 --> 01:02:05,455
- How do you take your caviar, sir ?
- No caviar for me, thanks.

794
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,092
Never did like it much.

795
01:02:08,261 --> 01:02:11,464
And where exactly do you live,
Mr Dawson ?

796
01:02:11,556 --> 01:02:14,806
Well, right now my address
is the RMS Titanic.

797
01:02:14,892 --> 01:02:17,181
After that l'm on God's good humour.

798
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:19,595
And how is it you have means to travel ?

799
01:02:19,689 --> 01:02:24,647
l work my way from place to place.
You know, tramp steamers and such.

800
01:02:24,735 --> 01:02:28,733
But l won my ticket on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.

801
01:02:28,823 --> 01:02:30,531
A very lucky hand.

802
01:02:31,284 --> 01:02:33,323
All life is a game of luck.

803
01:02:33,411 --> 01:02:37,455
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.
Right, Dawson ?

804
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:38,915
Mm.

805
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,875
And you find that sort of rootless
existence appealing, do you ?

806
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,629
Well, yes, ma'am, l do.

807
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:51,631
l mean... Got everything l need
right here with me.

808
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:54,472
Got air in my lungs
and a few sheets of paper.

809
01:02:54,557 --> 01:02:58,305
l love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's gonna happen...

810
01:02:58,394 --> 01:03:02,606
..or who l'm gonna meet,
where l'm gonna wind up.

811
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:05,062
The other night l slept under a bridge.

812
01:03:05,151 --> 01:03:08,068
Now l'm on the grandest ship
in the world...

813
01:03:08,154 --> 01:03:11,024
..having champagne
with you fine people.

814
01:03:11,115 --> 01:03:15,528
l figure life's a gift
and l don't intend on wasting it.

815
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:19,831
You never know what hand
you're gonna get dealt next.

816
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:23,700
You learn to take life
as it comes at you,...

817
01:03:24,462 --> 01:03:26,501
..to make each day count.

818
01:03:26,589 --> 01:03:28,297
Well said, Jack.

819
01:03:28,382 --> 01:03:29,663
Hear, hear !

820
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:32,297
To making it count.

821
01:03:33,805 --> 01:03:35,881
(All) To making it count.

822
01:03:35,973 --> 01:03:37,005
Bravo !

823
01:03:40,603 --> 01:03:42,679
(Molly laughing)

824
01:03:44,273 --> 01:03:49,066
Mr Brown had no idea
l'd hidden the money in the stove !

825
01:03:49,153 --> 01:03:53,198
So he comes home drunk as a pig
and he lights a fire !

826
01:03:55,993 --> 01:03:58,828
Next it'll be brandies
in the smoking room.

827
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:02,996
Join me in a brandy, gentlemen ?

828
01:04:03,084 --> 01:04:05,657
Now they retreat
into a cloud of smoke...

829
01:04:05,753 --> 01:04:09,371
..and congratulate each other
on being masters of the universe.

830
01:04:09,465 --> 01:04:11,588
Ladies, thank you for your company.

831
01:04:11,676 --> 01:04:15,508
- May l escort you to the cabin ?
- No, l'll stay here.

832
01:04:15,596 --> 01:04:17,340
Here you go, Molly.

833
01:04:18,391 --> 01:04:20,680
(Archie) Joining us, Dawson ?

834
01:04:20,768 --> 01:04:23,140
Don't want to stay with the women,
do you ?

835
01:04:23,229 --> 01:04:26,016
No, thanks.
l've gotta be heading back.

836
01:04:26,107 --> 01:04:31,065
Probably best. lt'll be all business
and politics. Wouldn't interest you.

837
01:04:32,196 --> 01:04:34,770
But, Dawson... Good of you to come.

838
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,660
Jack, must you go ?

839
01:04:41,747 --> 01:04:44,285
Time for me to row
with the other slaves.

840
01:04:47,587 --> 01:04:50,042
Good night, Rose.

841
01:05:16,157 --> 01:05:17,948
(clock chiming)

842
01:05:29,462 --> 01:05:32,131
So you wanna go to a real party ?

843
01:05:41,474 --> 01:05:43,431
ls okay l put my hand here ?

844
01:05:43,518 --> 01:05:44,549
Okay !

845
01:05:58,157 --> 01:06:00,114
Talla frikken svenska ?

846
01:06:00,201 --> 01:06:01,316
What ?

847
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:03,284
(repeats phrase)

848
01:06:03,371 --> 01:06:05,447
l can't understand you.

849
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:16,925
(glass shatters)

850
01:06:31,232 --> 01:06:32,726
Hey... !

851
01:06:32,817 --> 01:06:34,856
Bravo ! Bravo !

852
01:06:34,944 --> 01:06:37,186
Come on, guys, let's go ! Ho !

853
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,530
l'm gonna dance with her now,
all right ?

854
01:06:40,616 --> 01:06:41,696
Come on.

855
01:06:41,784 --> 01:06:43,278
Come on !

856
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:44,400
Come with me.

857
01:06:44,495 --> 01:06:46,452
Jack... Jack, wait !

858
01:06:48,124 --> 01:06:49,748
l can't do this.

859
01:06:49,834 --> 01:06:51,910
We have to get a bit closer.

860
01:06:52,003 --> 01:06:53,663
Like this.

861
01:06:55,923 --> 01:06:58,331
You're still my best girl, Cora.

862
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:05,134
- l don't know the steps.
- Neither do l. Just go with it.

863
01:07:05,224 --> 01:07:07,051
Don't think.

864
01:07:25,745 --> 01:07:28,662
Wait, Jack ! Wait ! Stop, Jack !

865
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:39,670
Wait !

866
01:08:19,549 --> 01:08:20,877
(Jack) Yeah !

867
01:08:20,967 --> 01:08:22,758
Jack... No !

868
01:08:22,844 --> 01:08:25,251
Whaaa...

869
01:08:28,307 --> 01:08:32,471
..jurisdiction of the Sherman Act,
so my lawyers will argue.

870
01:08:32,562 --> 01:08:36,144
That's what Rockefeller said,
but the court is not swallowing it.

871
01:08:56,169 --> 01:08:57,663
What ?

872
01:08:57,753 --> 01:09:01,122
You think a first-class girl can't drink ?

873
01:09:01,215 --> 01:09:03,255
Get outta here !

874
01:09:03,342 --> 01:09:05,501
You all right ?

875
01:09:09,348 --> 01:09:11,637
Two out of three, two out of three.

876
01:09:11,726 --> 01:09:12,924
So...

877
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:16,642
You think you're big, tough men ?

878
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:18,854
Let's see you do this.

879
01:09:20,276 --> 01:09:22,565
Hold this for me, Jack.

880
01:09:22,653 --> 01:09:24,527
Hold it up.

881
01:09:38,461 --> 01:09:39,492
Ow !

882
01:09:40,505 --> 01:09:42,544
Jesus, Mary and Joseph !

883
01:09:42,632 --> 01:09:45,835
- You all right ?
- l haven't done that in years !

884
01:09:53,893 --> 01:09:56,810
Go see Maggie, lads. Let's go !

885
01:10:22,505 --> 01:10:24,581
Coffee, sir ?

886
01:10:32,306 --> 01:10:35,640
l had hoped you would
come to me last night.

887
01:10:38,146 --> 01:10:40,387
l was tired.

888
01:10:40,481 --> 01:10:44,609
Your exertions below decks
were no doubt exhausting.

889
01:10:46,904 --> 01:10:52,243
l see you had that undertaker
of a manservant follow me. How typical.

890
01:10:52,326 --> 01:10:56,988
You will never behave like that again,
Rose. Do you understand ?

891
01:10:57,123 --> 01:11:01,452
l'm not a foreman in one of your mills
that you can command.

892
01:11:01,544 --> 01:11:04,296
l'm your fianc閑.

893
01:11:05,882 --> 01:11:07,921
My fianc閑 ? My fianc閑 ?!

894
01:11:08,009 --> 01:11:11,378
Yes, you are, and my wife !

895
01:11:11,471 --> 01:11:16,216
M wife in practice if not yet by law,
so you will honour me.

896
01:11:16,309 --> 01:11:19,678
You will honour me
the way a wife is required to.

897
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,680
l will not be made a fool of.

898
01:11:21,772 --> 01:11:24,098
ls this in any way unclear ?

899
01:11:25,193 --> 01:11:26,438
No.

900
01:11:26,527 --> 01:11:27,938
Good.

901
01:11:28,029 --> 01:11:30,068
Excuse me.

902
01:11:34,869 --> 01:11:36,778
Miss Rose !

903
01:11:36,871 --> 01:11:40,619
- We had a little... accident.
- That's all right, Miss Rose.

904
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:43,579
l'm sorry, Trudy. Let me help you.

905
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:45,745
lt's all right, miss.

906
01:11:51,344 --> 01:11:53,420
lt's all right, miss.

907
01:11:58,476 --> 01:11:59,591
Tea, Trudy.

908
01:11:59,727 --> 01:12:01,767
Yes, ma'am.

909
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:22,082
You're not to see that boy again.
Do you understand me ?

910
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:24,871
Rose, l forbid it.

911
01:12:24,961 --> 01:12:28,828
Oh, stop it, Mother.
You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

912
01:12:28,965 --> 01:12:30,874
This is not a game.

913
01:12:30,967 --> 01:12:34,881
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.

914
01:12:34,971 --> 01:12:37,509
Of course l know it's gone.

915
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,680
You remind me every day.

916
01:12:39,767 --> 01:12:43,551
Your father left us nothing
but a legacy of bad debts...

917
01:12:43,646 --> 01:12:45,224
..hidden by a good name.

918
01:12:45,314 --> 01:12:48,399
That name is the only card
we have to play.

919
01:12:48,484 --> 01:12:50,560
l don't understand you.

920
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:53,561
lt is a fine match with Hockley.

921
01:12:53,656 --> 01:12:55,696
lt will ensure our survival.

922
01:12:55,783 --> 01:12:58,357
How can you put this on my shoulders ?

923
01:12:58,452 --> 01:13:00,160
Why are you being so selfish ?

924
01:13:00,246 --> 01:13:02,737
l'm being selfish ?

925
01:13:06,252 --> 01:13:09,835
Do you want to see me
working as a seamstress ?

926
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:13,373
ls that what you want ?

927
01:13:15,553 --> 01:13:18,589
To see our fine things
sold at auction ?

928
01:13:18,681 --> 01:13:21,717
Our memories scattered to the winds !

929
01:13:32,945 --> 01:13:35,567
lt's so unfair.

930
01:13:35,656 --> 01:13:37,732
Of course it's unfair.

931
01:13:38,993 --> 01:13:41,069
We're women.

932
01:13:42,955 --> 01:13:45,446
Our choices are never easy.

933
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:54,124
Hmm ?

934
01:14:06,604 --> 01:14:10,768
# Protect them by thy guardian hand...

935
01:14:10,858 --> 01:14:16,398
# ..from every peril on the land.

936
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:22,236
# O spirit, whom the father sent...

937
01:14:22,328 --> 01:14:26,373
# ..to spread across the firmament.

938
01:14:26,457 --> 01:14:31,119
# O wind of heaven, by thy might...

939
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:36,415
# ..save all who dare the eagle's flight.

940
01:14:36,509 --> 01:14:40,720
#And keep them by thy watchful...

941
01:14:42,765 --> 01:14:44,592
Hello, Mr Andrews.

942
01:14:44,684 --> 01:14:46,557
Hello, Jack.

943
01:14:54,318 --> 01:14:57,485
- Sir...
- l just need to talk to somebody...

944
01:14:57,572 --> 01:15:00,027
You're not supposed to be in here.

945
01:15:00,116 --> 01:15:02,155
# ..fire and foe,...

946
01:15:02,243 --> 01:15:03,654
# ..protect them...

947
01:15:03,744 --> 01:15:06,366
- You don't remember me ?
- No, l don't.

948
01:15:06,456 --> 01:15:09,243
- You'll have to turn around.
- He'll tell you.

949
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:10,662
l just...

950
01:15:10,751 --> 01:15:13,456
Mr Hockley and Mrs DeWitt Bukater...

951
01:15:13,546 --> 01:15:17,413
..continue to be appreciative
of your assistance.

952
01:15:17,508 --> 01:15:20,877
They asked me to give you this
in gratitude.

953
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:22,630
l don't want your money...

954
01:15:22,722 --> 01:15:28,760
You hold a third-class ticket. Your
presence here is no longer appropriate.

955
01:15:28,853 --> 01:15:30,892
Please, l just wanna speak to Rose...

956
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:34,764
Gentlemen, please see that Mr Dawson
gets back to where he belongs...

957
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:36,977
..and that he stays there.

958
01:15:37,069 --> 01:15:38,101
Yes, sir.

959
01:15:38,154 --> 01:15:40,230
Come along, you.

960
01:15:41,908 --> 01:15:45,193
# O hear us when we cry to Thee...

961
01:15:45,369 --> 01:15:50,993
# ..for those in peril on the sea.

962
01:15:51,042 --> 01:15:55,040
- Why two steering wheels ?
- We only use this near shore.

963
01:15:55,087 --> 01:15:58,919
Sir, another ice warning.
This one's from the Noordam.

964
01:15:58,966 --> 01:16:01,125
Thank you, Sparks.

965
01:16:02,011 --> 01:16:05,878
Oh, not to worry.
Quite normal for this time of year.

966
01:16:05,932 --> 01:16:10,843
ln fact, we're speeding up.
l've just ordered the last boilers lit.

967
01:16:14,607 --> 01:16:17,691
Okay, son, wind it up tight
like l showed you.

968
01:16:17,735 --> 01:16:19,811
Okay, let it go.

969
01:16:22,532 --> 01:16:24,489
- Was good, wasn't it ?
- Quite nice.

970
01:16:24,534 --> 01:16:26,526
That's excellent, son.

971
01:16:30,206 --> 01:16:33,622
(Rose) Mr Andrews, forgive me...

972
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:36,786
l did the sum in my head...

973
01:16:36,838 --> 01:16:41,416
With the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned...

974
01:16:41,467 --> 01:16:44,634
..it seems there are not enough
for everyone.

975
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:46,755
About half, actually.

976
01:16:46,848 --> 01:16:49,469
Rose, you miss nothing, do you ?

977
01:16:49,517 --> 01:16:52,434
ln fact,
l put in these new type davits...

978
01:16:52,478 --> 01:16:55,349
..which can take an extra row of boats.

979
01:16:55,398 --> 01:16:59,775
But it was thought by some
that the deck would look too cluttered...

980
01:16:59,819 --> 01:17:02,903
..so l was overruled.

981
01:17:02,947 --> 01:17:06,197
Waste of deck space
on an unsinkable ship.

982
01:17:06,242 --> 01:17:08,151
Sleep soundly, young Rose.

983
01:17:08,202 --> 01:17:11,452
l have built you a good ship,
strong and true.

984
01:17:11,497 --> 01:17:13,739
She is all the lifeboat you need.

985
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:15,867
Just keep heading aft.

986
01:17:15,918 --> 01:17:17,792
Come on.

987
01:17:21,466 --> 01:17:23,921
Jack, this is impossible.

988
01:17:23,968 --> 01:17:26,044
l can't see you.

989
01:17:26,095 --> 01:17:29,215
- l need to talk to you.
- No, Jack, no.

990
01:17:29,849 --> 01:17:31,925
Jack, l'm engaged.

991
01:17:33,644 --> 01:17:35,720
l'm marrying Cal.

992
01:17:35,771 --> 01:17:37,598
l love Cal.

993
01:17:39,984 --> 01:17:43,104
Rose... you're no picnic.

994
01:17:43,988 --> 01:17:46,740
You're a spoiled little brat, even.

995
01:17:46,782 --> 01:17:52,287
But you're the most amazingly
astounding, wonderful girl,...

996
01:17:52,330 --> 01:17:53,788
..woman,...

997
01:17:53,831 --> 01:17:56,666
- ..that l've ever known, and...
- Jack...

998
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:58,785
Let me try and get this out.

999
01:17:58,836 --> 01:18:00,663
You're ama...

1000
01:18:01,923 --> 01:18:05,422
l'm not an idiot.
l know how the world works.

1001
01:18:05,468 --> 01:18:10,260
l've got ten bucks in my pocket
and l have nothing to offer you.

1002
01:18:10,306 --> 01:18:12,382
l understand.

1003
01:18:12,683 --> 01:18:14,759
But l'm too involved now.

1004
01:18:14,811 --> 01:18:16,887
You jump, l jump, remember ?

1005
01:18:16,938 --> 01:18:22,478
l can't turn away without knowing
you'll be all right. That's all l want.

1006
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,396
Well, l'm fine.

1007
01:18:26,948 --> 01:18:29,783
l'll be fine... Really.

1008
01:18:29,826 --> 01:18:31,699
Really ?

1009
01:18:33,913 --> 01:18:35,989
l don't think so.

1010
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,916
They've got you trapped, Rose,
and you'll die if you don't break free.

1011
01:18:40,962 --> 01:18:44,212
Maybe not right away
because you're strong, but...

1012
01:18:44,257 --> 01:18:47,542
..that fire that l love about you, Rose,...

1013
01:18:47,593 --> 01:18:50,298
..that fire is gonna burn out.

1014
01:18:54,058 --> 01:18:57,059
lt's not up to you to save me, Jack.

1015
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,556
You're right.

1016
01:19:01,899 --> 01:19:04,473
Only you can do that.

1017
01:19:09,407 --> 01:19:11,483
l'm going back.

1018
01:19:11,534 --> 01:19:13,610
Leave me alone.

1019
01:19:23,629 --> 01:19:28,007
Tell Lucille about the disaster
you had with the stationer's.

1020
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:30,921
The invitations
had to be sent back twice.

1021
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:32,429
Oh, my dear !

1022
01:19:32,472 --> 01:19:36,552
And the dreadful bridesmaids' gowns
- what an odyssey that has been !

1023
01:19:36,601 --> 01:19:39,602
Rose decided she wanted lavender.

1024
01:19:39,645 --> 01:19:42,849
She knows l detest the colour,
so she did it to spite me.

1025
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:45,057
lf only you'd come to me sooner.

1026
01:19:45,109 --> 01:19:48,110
Ruth saw some of my designs
in ''La Mode lllustr閑''.

1027
01:19:48,154 --> 01:19:51,439
They were for the Duchess
of Marlborough's youngest.

1028
01:19:51,491 --> 01:19:54,824
They were quite charming.
But l think you'll agree, my dear,...

1029
01:19:54,869 --> 01:19:59,198
..together we've created something
of a phoenix from the ashes !

1030
01:20:11,844 --> 01:20:13,920
Hello, Jack.

1031
01:20:19,393 --> 01:20:21,469
l changed my mind.

1032
01:20:26,609 --> 01:20:30,192
- They said you might be...
- Shh...

1033
01:20:30,863 --> 01:20:32,939
Give me your hand.

1034
01:20:40,373 --> 01:20:43,243
Now close your eyes.

1035
01:20:43,292 --> 01:20:45,368
Go on.

1036
01:20:47,797 --> 01:20:49,873
Step up.

1037
01:20:52,468 --> 01:20:54,710
Now hold on to the railing.

1038
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:57,763
- Keep your eyes closed. Don't peek.
- l'm not.

1039
01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:01,426
Step up onto the rail.

1040
01:21:05,189 --> 01:21:07,265
Hold on... Hold on.

1041
01:21:07,316 --> 01:21:09,558
Keep your eyes closed.

1042
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:11,686
Do you trust me ?

1043
01:21:11,737 --> 01:21:13,730
l trust you.

1044
01:21:22,915 --> 01:21:24,540
All right...

1045
01:21:24,584 --> 01:21:26,660
Open your eyes.

1046
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:34,460
l'm flying !

1047
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:36,218
Jack !

1048
01:22:00,578 --> 01:22:04,741
# Come, Josephine,
on my flying machine,...

1049
01:22:04,791 --> 01:22:09,702
# ..going up, she goes,
up, she goes...

1050
01:22:55,508 --> 01:22:59,636
That was the last time
Titanic ever saw daylight.

1051
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:03,344
So we're up to dusk
the night of the sinking.

1052
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:05,467
Six hours to go.

1053
01:23:05,518 --> 01:23:10,678
Smith's standing there, the iceberg
warning in his fucking hand,...

1054
01:23:10,731 --> 01:23:13,436
..and he's ordering more speed.

1055
01:23:13,484 --> 01:23:17,067
26 years of experience
working against him.

1056
01:23:17,113 --> 01:23:21,989
He figures anything big enough
to sink the ship they'll see in time to turn.

1057
01:23:22,034 --> 01:23:27,159
But the ship's too big with too small
a rudder. Doesn't corner worth a damn.

1058
01:23:27,206 --> 01:23:29,413
Everything he knows is wrong.

1059
01:23:41,179 --> 01:23:44,298
lt's quite proper, l assure you !

1060
01:23:44,348 --> 01:23:46,424
This is the sitting room.

1061
01:23:47,477 --> 01:23:49,849
- Will this light do ?
- What ?

1062
01:23:49,896 --> 01:23:52,102
Don't artists need good light ?

1063
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:55,356
(French accent) l am not
used to working in such...

1064
01:23:55,401 --> 01:23:57,026
..horrible conditions.

1065
01:23:57,737 --> 01:23:59,611
Monet !

1066
01:23:59,989 --> 01:24:02,990
- Do you know his work ?
- Of course !

1067
01:24:03,075 --> 01:24:05,282
Look at his use of colour here !

1068
01:24:05,328 --> 01:24:07,320
l know, it's extraordinary.

1069
01:24:09,248 --> 01:24:13,328
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

1070
01:24:13,836 --> 01:24:16,837
Should we be expecting him
any time soon ?

1071
01:24:17,173 --> 01:24:20,458
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

1072
01:24:22,678 --> 01:24:24,754
That's nice !

1073
01:24:24,806 --> 01:24:27,261
What is it ? A sapphire ?

1074
01:24:27,308 --> 01:24:29,265
A diamond.

1075
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:31,101
A very rare diamond.

1076
01:24:33,189 --> 01:24:37,187
Jack, l want you to draw me
like one of your French girls...

1077
01:24:38,236 --> 01:24:40,275
..wearing this.

1078
01:24:40,321 --> 01:24:41,519
All right.

1079
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:45,275
Wearing only this.

1080
01:25:20,695 --> 01:25:22,522
The last thing l need...

1081
01:25:22,613 --> 01:25:26,943
..is another picture of me
looking like a porcelain doll.

1082
01:25:28,286 --> 01:25:30,409
As a paying customer...

1083
01:25:32,373 --> 01:25:34,911
..l expect to get what l want.

1084
01:25:52,268 --> 01:25:54,937
Over on the bed... the couch.

1085
01:26:03,237 --> 01:26:05,029
Go... lie down.

1086
01:26:07,909 --> 01:26:09,948
Tell me when it looks right.

1087
01:26:09,994 --> 01:26:12,699
Put your arm back the way it was.

1088
01:26:12,747 --> 01:26:14,241
Right.

1089
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:18,157
Put that other arm up...
That hand right by your face.

1090
01:26:18,211 --> 01:26:20,287
Right.

1091
01:26:21,672 --> 01:26:23,998
Now, head down...

1092
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,336
Eyes to me. Keep them on me.

1093
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:31,256
And try to stay still.

1094
01:26:50,576 --> 01:26:52,035
So serious !

1095
01:27:33,703 --> 01:27:38,199
l believe you are blushing,
Mr Big Artiste.

1096
01:27:41,461 --> 01:27:45,126
l can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

1097
01:27:45,173 --> 01:27:47,628
He does landscapes.

1098
01:27:47,675 --> 01:27:50,878
- Just relax your face.
- Sorry.

1099
01:27:50,928 --> 01:27:53,004
No laughing.

1100
01:28:23,169 --> 01:28:26,289
My heart was pounding
the whole time.

1101
01:28:26,589 --> 01:28:30,539
lt was the most erotic moment
of my life.

1102
01:28:34,305 --> 01:28:36,843
Up until then, at least.

1103
01:28:36,891 --> 01:28:38,718
So what happened next ?

1104
01:28:38,768 --> 01:28:42,552
You mean... did we do it ?

1105
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:47,146
Sorry to disappoint you, Mr Bodine.

1106
01:28:47,193 --> 01:28:49,648
Jack was very professional.

1107
01:28:58,287 --> 01:29:00,161
Thank you.

1108
01:29:07,672 --> 01:29:09,748
What are you doing ?

1109
01:29:09,799 --> 01:29:13,417
Will you put this back
in the safe for me ?

1110
01:29:24,063 --> 01:29:26,139
Would you excuse me ?

1111
01:29:27,191 --> 01:29:30,228
None of the stewards have seen her.

1112
01:29:30,278 --> 01:29:32,354
This is absurd.

1113
01:29:32,405 --> 01:29:36,272
lt's a ship. There's only
so many places she could be.

1114
01:29:36,325 --> 01:29:38,283
Lovejoy, find her.

1115
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,796
- Clear.
- Yes.

1116
01:29:58,473 --> 01:30:01,758
l don't think l've ever seen
such a flat calm.

1117
01:30:01,809 --> 01:30:03,553
Like a millpond.

1118
01:30:03,603 --> 01:30:05,679
Not a breath of wind.

1119
01:30:07,398 --> 01:30:10,233
lt will make the bergs harder to see...

1120
01:30:10,568 --> 01:30:13,320
..with no breaking water at the base.

1121
01:30:23,664 --> 01:30:25,574
Well, l'm off.

1122
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:28,958
Maintain speed and heading,
Mr Lightoller.

1123
01:30:29,003 --> 01:30:30,497
Yes, sir.

1124
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:43,216
lt's getting cold.

1125
01:30:43,267 --> 01:30:44,892
You look nice.

1126
01:30:44,936 --> 01:30:46,560
(Lovejoy) Miss Rose ?

1127
01:30:46,604 --> 01:30:48,063
My drawings !

1128
01:30:54,445 --> 01:30:56,734
(door closes)

1129
01:31:18,427 --> 01:31:19,886
Wait !

1130
01:31:19,929 --> 01:31:21,720
Wait, wait, wait !

1131
01:31:21,764 --> 01:31:22,843
Go, go !

1132
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:24,135
Down, down !

1133
01:31:31,232 --> 01:31:32,263
Bye !

1134
01:31:39,699 --> 01:31:40,730
Sorry !

1135
01:31:58,134 --> 01:32:00,969
Pretty tough for a valet, this fellow.

1136
01:32:01,012 --> 01:32:03,882
- Seems more like a cop.
- l think he was.

1137
01:32:03,931 --> 01:32:06,303
(Jack) Oh, shit !

1138
01:32:11,022 --> 01:32:13,098
No, over here !

1139
01:32:13,149 --> 01:32:14,773
Quick !

1140
01:32:17,445 --> 01:32:19,521
(boiler blasting)

1141
01:32:20,907 --> 01:32:22,567
Now what !

1142
01:32:22,617 --> 01:32:23,992
What !

1143
01:32:30,917 --> 01:32:33,586
What are you two doing here ?

1144
01:32:33,628 --> 01:32:36,249
You shouldn't be here !
lt's dangerous !

1145
01:32:40,092 --> 01:32:41,752
(Jack) Carry on !

1146
01:32:41,803 --> 01:32:45,966
Don't mind us ! You're doing a greatjob !
Keep up the good work !

1147
01:33:02,156 --> 01:33:04,647
Look what we have here, huh ?

1148
01:33:14,335 --> 01:33:16,411
(Rose clears throat)

1149
01:33:22,385 --> 01:33:24,259
Thank you.

1150
01:33:33,437 --> 01:33:35,229
(honks horn)

1151
01:33:35,273 --> 01:33:37,349
Where to, miss ?

1152
01:33:38,526 --> 01:33:40,602
To the stars.

1153
01:33:59,046 --> 01:34:01,122
Are you nervous ?

1154
01:34:03,426 --> 01:34:05,502
No.

1155
01:34:21,235 --> 01:34:23,726
Put your hands on me, Jack.

1156
01:34:46,135 --> 01:34:48,626
(Crewman) God, it's bloody cold.

1157
01:34:48,679 --> 01:34:52,594
You know, l can smell ice,
you know... when it's near.

1158
01:34:54,185 --> 01:34:55,560
Bollocks.

1159
01:34:55,603 --> 01:34:57,512
But l can, all right ?

1160
01:34:57,563 --> 01:35:00,185
Did you ever find those binoculars ?

1161
01:35:00,233 --> 01:35:02,902
Haven't seen them since Southampton.

1162
01:35:02,944 --> 01:35:05,613
Well, l'll be on my rounds. Cheerio.

1163
01:35:37,228 --> 01:35:39,304
You're trembling.

1164
01:35:40,648 --> 01:35:43,317
Don't worry. l'll be all right.

1165
01:36:04,213 --> 01:36:06,206
They ran down there.

1166
01:36:06,257 --> 01:36:07,716
Right.

1167
01:36:17,018 --> 01:36:19,094
Anything missing ?

1168
01:36:43,586 --> 01:36:45,662
l've got a better idea.

1169
01:36:57,725 --> 01:36:59,267
Gotcha !

1170
01:37:01,354 --> 01:37:03,430
(Rose laughing)

1171
01:37:09,654 --> 01:37:11,860
Did you see those guys' faces ?

1172
01:37:12,281 --> 01:37:14,357
Did you see the... ?

1173
01:37:20,331 --> 01:37:22,869
When the ship docks...

1174
01:37:22,917 --> 01:37:24,993
..l'm getting off with you.

1175
01:37:25,044 --> 01:37:27,333
This is crazy.

1176
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:29,871
l know ! lt doesn't make any sense.

1177
01:37:31,342 --> 01:37:33,418
That's why l trust it.

1178
01:37:42,019 --> 01:37:45,223
Oh, yes... Here, look at this.

1179
01:37:45,273 --> 01:37:49,769
- Look at that, would ya ?
- They're a bit warmer than we are.

1180
01:37:49,819 --> 01:37:55,359
Well, if that's what it takes for us
to get warm, l'd rather not !

1181
01:38:06,210 --> 01:38:08,250
Bugger me !

1182
01:38:08,296 --> 01:38:10,087
(alarm bell clanging)

1183
01:38:11,966 --> 01:38:13,081
(phone)

1184
01:38:13,134 --> 01:38:15,126
Pick up, you bastards !

1185
01:38:15,178 --> 01:38:17,847
(phone ringing)

1186
01:38:17,889 --> 01:38:21,174
- ls there anyone there ?!
- Yes, what do you see ?

1187
01:38:21,225 --> 01:38:22,850
lceberg ! Right ahead !

1188
01:38:22,935 --> 01:38:24,727
Thank you.

1189
01:38:25,521 --> 01:38:27,430
lceberg ! Right ahead !

1190
01:38:27,482 --> 01:38:29,770
Hard to starboard !

1191
01:38:34,822 --> 01:38:36,233
(ringing)

1192
01:38:36,282 --> 01:38:38,855
(Crewman) Turn ! Turn ! Steady !

1193
01:38:40,828 --> 01:38:42,702
(bell clangs)

1194
01:38:43,498 --> 01:38:45,122
Full astern !

1195
01:38:46,876 --> 01:38:48,335
Hard over !

1196
01:38:48,377 --> 01:38:50,453
Helm's hard over, sir !

1197
01:38:52,131 --> 01:38:53,875
(ringing)

1198
01:38:53,925 --> 01:38:55,716
Go, lads ! Go !

1199
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:04,258
Shut all the dampers !

1200
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:06,101
Shut them !

1201
01:39:06,145 --> 01:39:08,102
(dampers slamming)

1202
01:39:10,066 --> 01:39:11,560
Hold it !

1203
01:39:12,693 --> 01:39:13,891
Hold it !

1204
01:39:15,321 --> 01:39:18,275
Now ! Engage the reversing engine !

1205
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:21,859
(engine stops)

1206
01:39:27,166 --> 01:39:29,242
(engine restarts)

1207
01:39:45,309 --> 01:39:47,682
Why aren't they turning ?!

1208
01:39:47,728 --> 01:39:49,306
ls it hard over ?!

1209
01:39:49,355 --> 01:39:51,763
lt is, yes, sir, hard over !

1210
01:39:54,861 --> 01:39:58,693
Come on... come on... come on...

1211
01:39:58,739 --> 01:40:00,234
Turn...

1212
01:40:10,501 --> 01:40:12,245
Yes...

1213
01:40:16,966 --> 01:40:19,042
lt's going to hit !

1214
01:40:30,229 --> 01:40:31,854
Jesus Christ !

1215
01:40:45,536 --> 01:40:48,288
(glass tinkling)

1216
01:40:51,959 --> 01:40:53,786
Jesus...

1217
01:40:53,836 --> 01:40:55,034
Hard to port !

1218
01:40:55,087 --> 01:40:56,630
(Crewman) Hard to port !

1219
01:41:00,301 --> 01:41:02,341
(men screaming)

1220
01:41:06,390 --> 01:41:08,264
Get back !

1221
01:41:37,296 --> 01:41:40,748
Come on, let's go !
They're closing the doors !

1222
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,424
Get out !

1223
01:41:43,511 --> 01:41:45,587
Get out ! Get out !

1224
01:41:48,683 --> 01:41:50,094
Get out the door !

1225
01:41:50,143 --> 01:41:51,305
Go on !

1226
01:41:51,352 --> 01:41:53,179
Come on, lads !

1227
01:41:53,229 --> 01:41:54,509
Go, lads, go !

1228
01:42:01,821 --> 01:42:02,734
Get out !

1229
01:42:22,675 --> 01:42:24,050
Oh, my God...

1230
01:42:24,093 --> 01:42:26,798
That was a close shave, weren't it ?

1231
01:42:26,846 --> 01:42:30,179
Smell ice, can ya ? Bleedin' Christ !

1232
01:42:33,811 --> 01:42:37,014
Note the time and enter it in the log.

1233
01:42:42,278 --> 01:42:44,520
What was that, Mr Murdoch ?

1234
01:42:44,572 --> 01:42:46,778
An iceberg, sir.

1235
01:42:46,824 --> 01:42:50,608
l put her hard to starboard
and ran the engines full astern...

1236
01:42:50,661 --> 01:42:54,244
..but it was too close.
l tried to port round it, but she hit and...

1237
01:42:54,290 --> 01:42:58,039
- Close the watertight doors.
- Doors are closed, sir.

1238
01:43:00,463 --> 01:43:02,835
All stop.

1239
01:43:05,009 --> 01:43:07,085
(ringing)

1240
01:43:09,263 --> 01:43:12,181
Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.

1241
01:43:12,225 --> 01:43:13,256
Yes, sir !

1242
01:43:16,938 --> 01:43:19,725
(Fabrizio) Porca puttana !

1243
01:43:19,774 --> 01:43:21,850
Che cazzo e ?

1244
01:43:23,653 --> 01:43:26,488
Come on,
let's get the hell out of here !

1245
01:43:26,531 --> 01:43:28,322
Come on, hurry up !

1246
01:43:33,037 --> 01:43:36,323
Why have the engines stopped ?
l felt a shudder.

1247
01:43:36,374 --> 01:43:40,917
l shouldn't worry, madam.
We've likely thrown a propeller blade.

1248
01:43:40,962 --> 01:43:43,879
- May l bring you anything ?
- No, thank you.

1249
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:53,298
- Did you see anything ?
- l don't see anything now, do you ?

1250
01:43:54,308 --> 01:43:58,686
lf this is the direction the rats are going,
that's good enough for me.

1251
01:44:00,398 --> 01:44:03,981
Please, sir, please...
everything's under control.

1252
01:44:05,236 --> 01:44:07,905
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.

1253
01:44:07,947 --> 01:44:10,403
- l have been robbed.
- Get the master-at-arms.

1254
01:44:10,449 --> 01:44:13,201
- Now, you moron !
- Yes, sir.

1255
01:44:13,244 --> 01:44:15,486
(men laughing)

1256
01:44:17,290 --> 01:44:19,578
Hey, you're gonna miss the fun.

1257
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:24,121
- Did you see what happened ?
- No. Apparently, it hit over there.

1258
01:44:25,673 --> 01:44:28,674
lt's flooded eight feet
and the mail hold is worse.

1259
01:44:28,718 --> 01:44:31,921
- Can you shore up ?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.

1260
01:44:31,971 --> 01:44:35,803
- Have you seen the mail-hold damage ?
- No, she's already underwater.

1261
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:37,926
This is bad.

1262
01:44:38,102 --> 01:44:40,261
We should tell Mother and Cal.

1263
01:44:42,523 --> 01:44:44,812
l think they're very good, sir.

1264
01:44:45,818 --> 01:44:50,195
Don't touch anything.
l want the entire room photographed.

1265
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:52,611
(Rose) Just keep holding my hand.

1266
01:44:54,827 --> 01:44:57,318
We've been looking for you, miss.

1267
01:45:01,042 --> 01:45:03,331
(Rose) Well, here we go.

1268
01:45:08,174 --> 01:45:10,629
Something serious has happened.

1269
01:45:12,094 --> 01:45:14,052
Yes, it has.

1270
01:45:14,096 --> 01:45:18,675
lndeed. Two things dear to me
have disappeared this evening.

1271
01:45:18,726 --> 01:45:23,684
Now that one is back, l've an idea
where to find the other. Search him.

1272
01:45:23,731 --> 01:45:26,602
- Take your coat off, sir.
- Now what ?

1273
01:45:26,651 --> 01:45:29,023
Cal, we're in the middle
of an emergency.

1274
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:30,813
What's going on ?

1275
01:45:30,863 --> 01:45:32,690
- ls this it ?
- That's it.

1276
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:35,065
This is horseshit !

1277
01:45:35,117 --> 01:45:37,276
Don't you believe it, Rose !

1278
01:45:37,328 --> 01:45:41,824
- He couldn't have.
- Of course he could.

1279
01:45:41,874 --> 01:45:44,330
But l was with him the whole time.

1280
01:45:44,377 --> 01:45:49,086
Perhaps he did it while you were
putting your clothes back on, dear.

1281
01:45:49,132 --> 01:45:51,373
Rose, they put it in my pocket.

1282
01:45:51,425 --> 01:45:52,505
Shut up.

1283
01:45:52,552 --> 01:45:54,509
lt isn't even your pocket.

1284
01:45:54,554 --> 01:45:56,214
Property of AL Ryerson.

1285
01:46:00,434 --> 01:46:04,728
- That was reported stolen.
- l borrowed it. l was gonna return it.

1286
01:46:04,772 --> 01:46:08,936
- We have an honest thief, do we ?
- You know l didn't do this, Rose.

1287
01:46:08,985 --> 01:46:11,939
Don't you believe them, Rose.

1288
01:46:11,988 --> 01:46:15,191
You know l didn't do it.
You know l didn't do it, Rose !

1289
01:46:15,241 --> 01:46:17,732
Come on, son. There's a good lad.

1290
01:46:17,785 --> 01:46:18,816
Come on.

1291
01:46:18,870 --> 01:46:21,242
You know l didn't do it !
You know me !

1292
01:46:22,957 --> 01:46:26,077
(lsmay) Most unfortunate, Captain.

1293
01:46:28,463 --> 01:46:31,997
Water... 14 feet above the keel
in 10 minutes...

1294
01:46:32,425 --> 01:46:35,960
..in the forepeak, in all three holds
and in boiler room six.

1295
01:46:36,012 --> 01:46:37,423
That's right, sir.

1296
01:46:37,472 --> 01:46:42,180
- When can we get under way, damn it !
- That's five compartments !

1297
01:46:42,310 --> 01:46:47,600
She can stay afloat with the first four
compartments breached, but not five.

1298
01:46:47,648 --> 01:46:49,143
Not five.

1299
01:46:49,192 --> 01:46:51,315
As she goes down by the head...

1300
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:55,690
..the water will spill over
the bulkheads, from one to the next.

1301
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:58,610
Back and back.
There's no stopping it.

1302
01:46:58,659 --> 01:46:59,655
The pumps...

1303
01:46:59,702 --> 01:47:03,616
The pumps buy you time,
but minutes only.

1304
01:47:03,664 --> 01:47:06,535
From this moment,
no matter what we do,...

1305
01:47:06,584 --> 01:47:09,289
..Titanic will founder.

1306
01:47:11,631 --> 01:47:13,707
But this ship can't sink.

1307
01:47:13,758 --> 01:47:16,794
She's made of iron, sir.
l assure you she can,...

1308
01:47:16,844 --> 01:47:19,252
..and she will.

1309
01:47:19,305 --> 01:47:21,878
lt is a mathematical certainty.

1310
01:47:25,311 --> 01:47:27,387
How much time ?

1311
01:47:33,444 --> 01:47:35,022
An hour...

1312
01:47:35,071 --> 01:47:37,277
Two at most.

1313
01:47:42,036 --> 01:47:44,907
And how many aboard, Mr Murdoch ?

1314
01:47:44,956 --> 01:47:47,529
2,200 souls on board, sir.

1315
01:47:53,548 --> 01:47:57,711
Well, l believe you may get
your headlines, Mr lsmay.

1316
01:48:15,317 --> 01:48:19,695
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it ?
Look at me when l'm talking to you !

1317
01:48:19,738 --> 01:48:21,067
(knock at door)

1318
01:48:21,115 --> 01:48:23,403
- Mr Hockley ?
- Not now ! We're busy !

1319
01:48:23,450 --> 01:48:26,072
Sir, please put on your lifebelt...

1320
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:29,074
l said not now.

1321
01:48:29,123 --> 01:48:33,417
l'm sorry but it's Captain's orders.
Now, please, dress warmly.

1322
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:35,786
lt's quite cold out tonight.

1323
01:48:35,838 --> 01:48:38,293
May l suggest topcoats and hats ?

1324
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:40,416
This is ridiculous.

1325
01:48:41,218 --> 01:48:45,465
Not to worry, miss.
l am sure it's just a precaution.

1326
01:48:45,514 --> 01:48:47,756
Everybody up ! Lifebelts on !

1327
01:48:49,268 --> 01:48:50,846
What's he on about ?

1328
01:48:50,895 --> 01:48:53,350
- Lifebelts on !
- What's the ruckus ?

1329
01:48:53,397 --> 01:48:55,188
Just put your lifebelts on !

1330
01:48:55,274 --> 01:48:57,682
(Crewman) CQD ?

1331
01:48:57,735 --> 01:48:59,608
Sir ?

1332
01:48:59,904 --> 01:49:03,273
That's right. CQD. The distress call.

1333
01:49:03,365 --> 01:49:05,073
That's our position.

1334
01:49:09,079 --> 01:49:13,124
Tell whoever responds
that we're going down by the head...

1335
01:49:13,167 --> 01:49:16,168
..and need immediate assistance.

1336
01:49:24,303 --> 01:49:26,177
Blimey !

1337
01:49:36,190 --> 01:49:38,811
Keep lowering ! Keep lowering !

1338
01:49:59,129 --> 01:50:00,672
Mr Wilde !

1339
01:50:00,714 --> 01:50:02,754
Where are the passengers ?

1340
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:07,628
We moved them back inside.
lt's too damn cold and noisy for them.

1341
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:08,960
(blows whistle)

1342
01:50:09,014 --> 01:50:11,007
Help with these lines !

1343
01:50:11,058 --> 01:50:14,807
(orchestra playing
''Alexander's Ragtime Band'')

1344
01:50:25,364 --> 01:50:27,440
Care for a drink, sir ?

1345
01:50:28,909 --> 01:50:32,859
Hey, sonny, what's doing ?
You got us all trussed up here...

1346
01:50:32,913 --> 01:50:37,409
- ..and now we're cooling our heels.
- Sorry, ma'am. Let me find out.

1347
01:50:37,459 --> 01:50:40,579
l don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on.

1348
01:50:40,629 --> 01:50:44,129
lt's the goddamned English
doing everything by the... book.

1349
01:50:44,174 --> 01:50:46,500
There's no need for language, Mr Hockley.

1350
01:50:46,552 --> 01:50:51,214
Go and turn the heaters on in our rooms.
l'd like a cup of tea when l return.

1351
01:50:51,265 --> 01:50:53,008
Yes, ma'am.

1352
01:50:54,768 --> 01:50:57,805
(Man) This ship
has 15 watertight barricades.

1353
01:50:57,855 --> 01:51:01,473
(Crewman) Would you
put your lifebelt on, please ?

1354
01:51:01,901 --> 01:51:03,015
Mr Andrews...

1355
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:09,027
l saw the iceberg,
and l see it in your eyes.

1356
01:51:09,074 --> 01:51:11,648
Please tell me the truth.

1357
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:20,576
The ship will sink.

1358
01:51:21,045 --> 01:51:23,084
You're certain ?

1359
01:51:23,130 --> 01:51:25,419
Yes. ln an hour or so...

1360
01:51:25,883 --> 01:51:29,833
..all this will be
at the bottom of the Atlantic.

1361
01:51:29,887 --> 01:51:31,547
What ?

1362
01:51:31,597 --> 01:51:36,389
Tell only who you must. l don't want
to be responsible for a panic.

1363
01:51:36,435 --> 01:51:39,187
And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait.

1364
01:51:39,230 --> 01:51:42,396
You remember what l told you
about the boats ?

1365
01:51:45,486 --> 01:51:47,277
Yes...

1366
01:51:48,405 --> 01:51:50,232
l understand.

1367
01:51:58,207 --> 01:52:00,034
Over here, sir.

1368
01:52:00,084 --> 01:52:04,662
Sir, they need you in the second-class
purser's office. There's a mob up there.

1369
01:52:04,713 --> 01:52:08,841
- Go on. l'll keep an eye on him.
- Aye. Right.

1370
01:52:21,564 --> 01:52:26,107
Sir ! Carpathia says
they're making 17 knots.

1371
01:52:26,151 --> 01:52:28,987
Full steam for them, sir.

1372
01:52:29,029 --> 01:52:32,315
- She's the only one responding ?
- The only one close, sir.

1373
01:52:32,366 --> 01:52:34,323
They can be here in four hours.

1374
01:52:34,368 --> 01:52:36,491
Four hours ?!

1375
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:43,576
Thank you, Bride.

1376
01:52:47,172 --> 01:52:49,249
My God... !

1377
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:51,376
(crewmen yelling out orders)

1378
01:52:56,724 --> 01:52:58,301
Sir !

1379
01:52:58,350 --> 01:53:00,841
We are swung out and ready, sir.

1380
01:53:00,895 --> 01:53:05,687
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boats, sir ?

1381
01:53:07,568 --> 01:53:09,359
Yes, we...

1382
01:53:09,403 --> 01:53:10,683
Sir ?

1383
01:53:13,282 --> 01:53:15,571
Women and children first.

1384
01:53:15,618 --> 01:53:17,444
Yes.

1385
01:53:17,494 --> 01:53:19,570
Yes, sir.

1386
01:53:21,248 --> 01:53:24,866
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please !

1387
01:53:24,919 --> 01:53:27,789
Step this way, please ! That's right.

1388
01:53:27,838 --> 01:53:29,961
Come towards me !

1389
01:53:30,007 --> 01:53:31,916
Thank you.

1390
01:53:31,967 --> 01:53:32,963
Good.

1391
01:53:33,052 --> 01:53:37,512
For the time being l shall require
only women and children.

1392
01:53:37,556 --> 01:53:39,632
Right here.

1393
01:53:39,683 --> 01:53:41,925
Like the Captain said,...

1394
01:53:41,977 --> 01:53:44,764
..nice and cheery
so there's no panic.

1395
01:53:44,813 --> 01:53:46,853
''Wedding Dance.''

1396
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:57,240
Lifebelts on !
Put your lifebelts on !

1397
01:53:57,284 --> 01:53:58,862
Put your lifebelts on !

1398
01:53:58,911 --> 01:54:02,446
Here, put your lifebelt on.
Here, come on...

1399
01:54:08,254 --> 01:54:11,124
lt isn't time to go up
to the boats yet.

1400
01:54:11,173 --> 01:54:13,213
Please stay calm.

1401
01:54:13,259 --> 01:54:17,091
Look, please make sure
you've got your lifebelts on.

1402
01:54:17,137 --> 01:54:19,463
Women and children to the front.

1403
01:54:19,515 --> 01:54:21,591
What are we doing, Mummy ?

1404
01:54:21,642 --> 01:54:26,637
When the first-class people
are in the boats, they'll start with us...

1405
01:54:26,689 --> 01:54:28,598
..and we'll want to be ready.

1406
01:54:28,649 --> 01:54:30,855
(men arguing)

1407
01:54:30,901 --> 01:54:33,024
Go and get some help.

1408
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:35,822
Lower away ! Left and right together !

1409
01:54:35,864 --> 01:54:37,323
Steady !

1410
01:54:37,366 --> 01:54:39,572
Both sides together !

1411
01:54:39,618 --> 01:54:41,029
Steady !

1412
01:54:41,078 --> 01:54:42,537
Steady !

1413
01:54:42,580 --> 01:54:44,738
Steady !

1414
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:46,948
Stop ! Stop !

1415
01:54:47,001 --> 01:54:48,329
(screaming)

1416
01:54:48,377 --> 01:54:49,705
Hold the left side !

1417
01:54:49,753 --> 01:54:52,589
Right side only ! Right side only !

1418
01:54:52,631 --> 01:54:54,090
Right side only !

1419
01:54:54,133 --> 01:54:55,592
Hold the left side !

1420
01:54:55,634 --> 01:54:58,256
Right side down !
Lower away together !

1421
01:54:59,972 --> 01:55:02,048
Steady, lads !

1422
01:55:49,605 --> 01:55:53,472
You know, l do believe this ship may sink.

1423
01:55:53,567 --> 01:55:58,941
l've been asked to give you this
small token of our appreciation.

1424
01:56:02,159 --> 01:56:04,864
Compliments of Mr Caledon Hockley.

1425
01:56:11,085 --> 01:56:14,418
Come on, sister, you heard the man.
lnto the boat.

1426
01:56:14,463 --> 01:56:19,920
- Any room for a gentleman, gentlemen ?
- Only women at this time, sir.

1427
01:56:19,969 --> 01:56:24,132
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class ?

1428
01:56:25,641 --> 01:56:28,595
l hope they're not too crowded.

1429
01:56:28,644 --> 01:56:32,594
Oh, Mother... Shut up !
Don't you understand ?!

1430
01:56:32,648 --> 01:56:37,274
The water is freezing and there aren't
enough boats ! Not enough by half.

1431
01:56:37,319 --> 01:56:40,854
Half the people on this ship
are going to die.

1432
01:56:40,906 --> 01:56:43,029
Not the better half.

1433
01:56:43,075 --> 01:56:45,613
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.

1434
01:56:45,661 --> 01:56:48,448
First-class seats are right up here.

1435
01:56:48,497 --> 01:56:52,744
lt's a pity l didn't keep that drawing.
lt'll be worth more by morning.

1436
01:56:52,793 --> 01:56:56,791
(Crewman) Women and children
towards the front.

1437
01:56:56,839 --> 01:56:59,081
You unimaginable bastard.

1438
01:57:00,009 --> 01:57:04,469
(Molly) Come on, Rose, darling.
There's plenty of room for you.

1439
01:57:04,513 --> 01:57:08,725
- Come on, Rose. You're next.
- Come into the boat, Rose.

1440
01:57:09,602 --> 01:57:11,179
(Cal) Come.

1441
01:57:11,228 --> 01:57:13,102
Rose !

1442
01:57:13,939 --> 01:57:16,015
Get into the boat !

1443
01:57:16,066 --> 01:57:18,142
Rose...

1444
01:57:18,569 --> 01:57:20,561
Goodbye, Mother.

1445
01:57:22,323 --> 01:57:23,983
Rose ?

1446
01:57:24,033 --> 01:57:26,654
Where are you going ?

1447
01:57:26,702 --> 01:57:28,659
To him ?!

1448
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:31,112
To be a whore to a gutter rat ?!

1449
01:57:31,165 --> 01:57:33,952
l'd rather be his whore
than your wife !

1450
01:57:36,212 --> 01:57:37,789
No... No !

1451
01:57:38,964 --> 01:57:41,253
l said no !

1452
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:43,091
(Ruth) Rose !

1453
01:57:43,135 --> 01:57:45,128
Please stop !

1454
01:57:45,179 --> 01:57:48,263
- And lower away !
- Rose !

1455
01:57:48,307 --> 01:57:50,715
- Man the tiller !
- No, wait !

1456
01:57:50,768 --> 01:57:53,140
Rose !

1457
01:57:53,187 --> 01:57:55,393
Hold the left side there !

1458
01:57:58,317 --> 01:57:59,480
Help !

1459
01:57:59,526 --> 01:58:02,730
Can anybody hear me !

1460
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:05,816
Hello, help me !

1461
01:58:05,866 --> 01:58:07,942
Help me !

1462
01:58:09,161 --> 01:58:11,735
Help me ! Can anybody hear me !

1463
01:58:11,789 --> 01:58:14,494
Somebody help me !

1464
01:58:15,876 --> 01:58:17,952
Mr Andrews !

1465
01:58:20,589 --> 01:58:22,878
Check the starboard corridor.

1466
01:58:22,925 --> 01:58:26,128
Madam, please, put on a lifebelt.

1467
01:58:26,178 --> 01:58:30,425
Lucy, for God's sake, put on
your lifebelt. Set a good example.

1468
01:58:30,474 --> 01:58:31,589
Anyone in here ?

1469
01:58:31,642 --> 01:58:36,434
Mr Andrews, thank God ! Where would
they take someone under arrest ?

1470
01:58:36,480 --> 01:58:39,267
You have to get to a boat right away.

1471
01:58:39,316 --> 01:58:43,812
l'm doing this with or without your help,
but without will take longer.

1472
01:58:44,655 --> 01:58:50,242
Take the elevator to the very bottom.
Go left down the crewmen's passage.

1473
01:58:50,286 --> 01:58:54,579
Go right and left again at the stairs.
You'll come to a corridor.

1474
01:58:58,502 --> 01:59:00,578
This could be bad.

1475
01:59:00,629 --> 01:59:02,005
(water gurgling)

1476
01:59:04,675 --> 01:59:06,418
Oh, shit.

1477
01:59:06,468 --> 01:59:08,046
Oh, shit !

1478
01:59:12,683 --> 01:59:14,261
Excuse me !

1479
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:17,429
- (Crewman) The lifts are closed.
- l do not care...

1480
01:59:17,479 --> 01:59:18,938
The lifts are...

1481
01:59:18,981 --> 01:59:23,192
l'm sorry, miss,
but the lifts are closed.

1482
01:59:23,235 --> 01:59:27,399
l'm through being polite,
goddamn it ! Now take me down !

1483
01:59:27,698 --> 01:59:29,109
''E'' deck.

1484
01:59:32,828 --> 01:59:35,449
Come on... Come on, come on...

1485
01:59:52,848 --> 01:59:54,342
l'm going back up !

1486
01:59:54,391 --> 01:59:55,589
No !

1487
01:59:55,643 --> 01:59:56,888
No ! No !

1488
01:59:56,936 --> 01:59:59,177
Miss, wait !

1489
02:00:00,064 --> 02:00:02,934
Come back ! l'm going back up !

1490
02:00:02,983 --> 02:00:04,228
l'm going back up !

1491
02:00:13,410 --> 02:00:15,486
Crew passage...

1492
02:00:15,829 --> 02:00:17,905
Crew passage.

1493
02:00:37,643 --> 02:00:39,221
Jack !

1494
02:00:42,523 --> 02:00:44,314
Jack !

1495
02:00:48,571 --> 02:00:50,029
Jack !

1496
02:00:50,406 --> 02:00:52,482

1497
02:00:53,325 --> 02:00:54,701

02:00:54,743 --> 02:00:56,368

1502
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:03,041
Jack ! Jack !

1503
02:01:03,085 --> 02:01:04,164
l'm sorry !

1504
02:01:04,211 --> 02:01:06,287
l'm sorry ! l'm so sorry !

1505
02:01:07,673 --> 02:01:11,623
- Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
- l know ! l know, l know, l know !

1506
02:01:11,677 --> 02:01:14,713
Rose, you have to find
a spare key, all right ?

1507
02:01:14,763 --> 02:01:16,258
Look in that cabinet.

1508
02:01:17,558 --> 02:01:20,131
lt's a little silver one, Rose.

1509
02:01:20,185 --> 02:01:21,977
Silver...

1510
02:01:22,021 --> 02:01:23,729
These are all brass !

1511
02:01:23,772 --> 02:01:26,180
Check right here, Rose.

1512
02:01:29,486 --> 02:01:31,194
Rose...

1513
02:01:32,239 --> 02:01:34,446
How did you find out l didn't do it ?

1514
02:01:34,491 --> 02:01:36,567
l didn't.

1515
02:01:36,785 --> 02:01:39,573
l just realised l already knew.

1516
02:01:40,915 --> 02:01:43,287
Keep looking !

1517
02:01:50,007 --> 02:01:51,632
No key.

1518
02:01:51,675 --> 02:01:54,712
- There's no key !
- Rose, listen.

1519
02:01:54,762 --> 02:01:56,635
You have to go find help.

1520
02:01:56,680 --> 02:01:58,258
lt'll be all right.

02:02:03,646 --> 02:02:05,472

1522
02:02:11,904 --> 02:02:14,311
l'll just wait here.

1523
02:02:27,586 --> 02:02:30,042
Hello, is there anyone here ?

1524
02:02:30,464 --> 02:02:32,006
Hello ?

02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:16,376
(loud rumbling)

1533
02:03:17,428 --> 02:03:19,504
(panting)

1534
02:03:28,188 --> 02:03:29,896
Hello ?

1535
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:34,686
- Miss, you shouldn't be here now.
- Please, l need your help.

1536
02:03:34,737 --> 02:03:37,821
There is a man down here
and he is trapped !

1537
02:03:37,865 --> 02:03:39,988
- No need to panic.
- l'm not panicking !

1538
02:03:40,034 --> 02:03:43,782
You're going the wrong way !
Let go of me ! Listen !

1539
02:03:49,043 --> 02:03:50,869
To hell with you.

1540
02:03:53,130 --> 02:03:55,206
(ship creaking)

1541
02:04:10,397 --> 02:04:12,473
(crewman shouting orders)

1542
02:04:13,651 --> 02:04:15,727
Lower away !

1543
02:04:22,159 --> 02:04:24,235
Oh, God...

1544
02:04:28,415 --> 02:04:30,491
Oh, my God...

1545
02:04:49,562 --> 02:04:51,222
(gasps)

1546
02:05:18,507 --> 02:05:20,215
Jack !

1547
02:05:20,259 --> 02:05:22,050
Rose !

1548
02:05:22,094 --> 02:05:24,170
Will this work ?

1549
02:05:25,097 --> 02:05:27,849
l guess we'll find out. Come on.

1550
02:05:30,185 --> 02:05:32,308
Wait, wait, wait, wait !

1551
02:05:32,354 --> 02:05:34,228
Try some practice swings.

1552
02:05:39,403 --> 02:05:43,187
Good. Try to hit the same mark
again, Rose. You can do it.

1553
02:05:49,747 --> 02:05:52,320
Okay. That's enough practice.

1554
02:05:52,374 --> 02:05:54,201
Come on, Rose. You can do it.

1555
02:05:54,251 --> 02:05:58,415
Listen, just hit it really hard
and really fast.

1556
02:06:00,007 --> 02:06:02,842
Wait ! Open your hands up
a little more.

1557
02:06:02,885 --> 02:06:05,257
- Like that ?
- Right.

1558
02:06:05,304 --> 02:06:08,139
Listen, Rose... l trust you.

1559
02:06:12,436 --> 02:06:14,429
Go !

1560
02:06:19,193 --> 02:06:20,735
You did it !

1561
02:06:20,778 --> 02:06:23,316
Come on, let's go !

1562
02:06:23,364 --> 02:06:25,819
Oh, shit, this is cold ! Oh, shit !

1563
02:06:25,866 --> 02:06:27,693
Shit ! Shit !

1564
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:34,249
This is the way out.

1565
02:06:34,291 --> 02:06:38,206
We have to find another way. Come on.

1566
02:06:38,254 --> 02:06:39,368
Pull !

1567
02:06:39,421 --> 02:06:41,165
(orchestra playing)

1568
02:06:41,215 --> 02:06:42,329
Pull !

1569
02:06:42,383 --> 02:06:44,921
Put your backs into it ! Pull !

1570
02:06:49,431 --> 02:06:51,056
Pull !

1571
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:55,050
Now there's something
you don't see every day.

1572
02:07:16,333 --> 02:07:20,663
What's this luggage doing here ?
Get rid of it ! We need the room !

1573
02:07:20,713 --> 02:07:22,789
(crewman giving orders)

1574
02:07:26,051 --> 02:07:27,759
Keep calm !

1575
02:07:28,846 --> 02:07:32,381
Move along there. Make more room.
That's right. Look sharp.

1576
02:07:34,476 --> 02:07:37,430
- Lovejoy !
- She's not on the starboard side.

1577
02:07:37,479 --> 02:07:42,188
We're running out of time and this
martinet isn't letting any men on.

1578
02:07:42,234 --> 02:07:44,808
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

1579
02:07:44,862 --> 02:07:49,571
Then that's our play. We'll need
some insurance first. Come on.

1580
02:07:49,700 --> 02:07:51,574
(banging)

1581
02:07:51,619 --> 02:07:53,907
This way. All the way down here.

1582
02:07:55,915 --> 02:07:59,366
Here ! What do you think you're doing ?

1583
02:07:59,418 --> 02:08:03,285
You'll have to pay for that !
That's White Star Line property !

1584
02:08:03,339 --> 02:08:04,667
Shut up !

1585
02:08:06,258 --> 02:08:10,801
Will you hold the boat a moment ?
l just have to run back to my room...

1586
02:08:10,846 --> 02:08:13,088
Sit down !

1587
02:08:13,140 --> 02:08:17,304
Mr Lightoller, why are the boats
being launched half full ?

1588
02:08:17,353 --> 02:08:21,849
- Not now, Mr Andrews.
- 20 or so in a boat built for 65...

1589
02:08:21,899 --> 02:08:24,271
..and l saw one boat with only 12 ! 12 !

1590
02:08:24,318 --> 02:08:28,944
We weren't sure of the weight,
Mr Andrews. These boats may buckle.

1591
02:08:28,989 --> 02:08:30,068
Rubbish !

1592
02:08:30,115 --> 02:08:33,116
They were tested in Belfast
with 70 men !

1593
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:37,537
Now fill these boats, Mr Lightoller,
for God's sake, man !

1594
02:08:43,045 --> 02:08:46,046
l need more women and children, please !

1595
02:08:49,969 --> 02:08:53,551
(Crewman) Get back in there.
This is not an exit.

1596
02:08:53,597 --> 02:08:57,381
- Get back in there.
- This is not an exit !

1597
02:08:57,810 --> 02:09:01,808
You can't keep us locked in here !
The ship's bloody sinking !

1598
02:09:01,855 --> 02:09:03,932
Bring forward the women !

1599
02:09:03,983 --> 02:09:06,059
Unlock the gates.

1600
02:09:06,944 --> 02:09:08,901
Women only !

1601
02:09:08,946 --> 02:09:10,773
No men !

1602
02:09:10,823 --> 02:09:12,697
No men !

1603
02:09:12,741 --> 02:09:14,817
(yelling)

1604
02:09:16,662 --> 02:09:18,738
Get back !

1605
02:09:21,166 --> 02:09:23,159
Lock the gates !

1606
02:09:23,210 --> 02:09:26,128
Get them back from those gates !

1607
02:09:26,171 --> 02:09:28,164
Don't touch the gates !

1608
02:09:30,801 --> 02:09:34,300
There are women and children
down here !

1609
02:09:34,346 --> 02:09:36,968
Let us up so we can have a chance !

1610
02:09:37,016 --> 02:09:39,092
Get back !

1611
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:43,145
- Jack !
- Tommy !

1612
02:09:43,188 --> 02:09:45,477
- Can we get out ?
- lt's hopeless that way !

1613
02:09:45,524 --> 02:09:47,268
Whatever we do,
we've gotta do it fast.

1614
02:09:47,318 --> 02:09:48,776
Jack !

1615
02:09:48,819 --> 02:09:50,444
Fabrizio !

1616
02:09:50,487 --> 02:09:52,361
The boats are all gone.

1617
02:09:52,406 --> 02:09:55,609
- This whole place is flooding.
- There is niente this way.

1618
02:09:55,659 --> 02:09:58,364
All right. Let's go this way. Come on.

1619
02:10:03,417 --> 02:10:05,326
l make my own luck.

1620
02:10:05,377 --> 02:10:07,417
So do l.

1621
02:10:15,304 --> 02:10:16,928
Come on !

1622
02:10:16,972 --> 02:10:19,179
No, come on. Let's go this way.

1623
02:10:21,352 --> 02:10:23,428
(speaking Arabic)

1624
02:10:27,775 --> 02:10:29,435
This way !

1625
02:10:29,485 --> 02:10:33,435
Go back to the main stairwell
and everything will be sorted out there.

1626
02:10:33,489 --> 02:10:34,864
The hell it will !

1627
02:10:34,907 --> 02:10:36,983
lt will get sorted out back there.

1628
02:10:37,034 --> 02:10:38,445
Go back to the main stairwell.

1629
02:10:38,494 --> 02:10:40,901
- Open the gate.
- Go back...

1630
02:10:40,955 --> 02:10:44,158
- Open the gate now !
- Go back down the main stairwell !

1631
02:10:46,126 --> 02:10:49,377
Goddamn it ! Son of a bitch !

1632
02:10:49,421 --> 02:10:50,916
Open the damn gate !

1633
02:10:50,965 --> 02:10:53,253
Go back !

1634
02:10:55,177 --> 02:10:59,341
- Fabri, Tommy. Give me a hand here !
- Move aside ! Move aside !

1635
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:01,098
Pull !

1636
02:11:01,976 --> 02:11:04,052
- Move aside !
- Put that down !

1637
02:11:04,144 --> 02:11:05,473
Move aside !

1638
02:11:05,521 --> 02:11:08,059
- One ! Two !
- Stop that !

1639
02:11:08,107 --> 02:11:09,352
Three !

1640
02:11:11,527 --> 02:11:12,606
Again !

1641
02:11:14,572 --> 02:11:15,651
Let's go !

1642
02:11:17,199 --> 02:11:18,528
Let's go, Rose.

1643
02:11:18,617 --> 02:11:22,033
You can't go up there !
You can't do this !

1644
02:11:26,667 --> 02:11:29,751
(Lightoller) Keep order ! Keep order here !

1645
02:11:29,795 --> 02:11:32,998
Back ! Back ! Back !

1646
02:11:34,008 --> 02:11:35,253
(screaming)

1647
02:11:37,094 --> 02:11:38,553
Hold on to her !

1648
02:11:40,055 --> 02:11:41,431
Pull her in !

1649
02:11:41,473 --> 02:11:44,558
Get back, l say !

1650
02:11:44,602 --> 02:11:46,927
Or l'll shoot you all like dogs !

1651
02:11:46,979 --> 02:11:49,055
Keep order here !

1652
02:11:49,565 --> 02:11:51,723
Keep order, l say.

1653
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:55,110
Mr Lowe, man this boat.

1654
02:11:59,033 --> 02:12:01,571
(Lowe) ls everybody all right ?

1655
02:12:01,619 --> 02:12:03,576
Nobody panic.

1656
02:12:09,084 --> 02:12:11,042
(Crewman) Stay back !

1657
02:12:11,086 --> 02:12:14,420
- We're too late.
- There are more boats at the front.

1658
02:12:14,465 --> 02:12:18,249
Stay with this one.
Murdoch seems to be quite practical.

1659
02:12:18,302 --> 02:12:20,211
(women screaming)

1660
02:12:32,524 --> 02:12:34,482
(Lowe) Sit down !

1661
02:12:34,985 --> 02:12:37,061
Stay back, you lot.

1662
02:12:37,154 --> 02:12:40,570
Stay back ! Stay back,
the lot of you ! Stay back !

1663
02:12:40,616 --> 02:12:41,612
(gunshots)

1664
02:12:41,659 --> 02:12:45,822
lt's starting to fall apart.
We don't have much time.

1665
02:12:46,914 --> 02:12:48,990
Mr Murdoch ?

1666
02:12:49,124 --> 02:12:50,287
Mr Hockley...

1667
02:12:50,376 --> 02:12:51,870
You two, with me, now !

1668
02:12:51,919 --> 02:12:55,869
l'm a businessman, as you know,
and l've a business proposition for you.

1669
02:12:55,923 --> 02:12:59,506
(Crewman) Easy now ! All together !

1670
02:12:59,552 --> 02:13:02,588
Lower away ! Lower away !

1671
02:13:02,638 --> 02:13:04,714
(Jack) Come on, Rose.

1672
02:13:07,560 --> 02:13:09,636
The boats are gone !

1673
02:13:13,357 --> 02:13:16,228
Colonel, are there any boats
on that side ?

1674
02:13:16,277 --> 02:13:20,321
No, miss, but there are a couple
of boats all the way forward.

1675
02:13:26,078 --> 02:13:29,945
What's the use ?
Nobody's listening to us, anyway.

1676
02:13:29,999 --> 02:13:32,916
They don't listen to us at dinner, either.

1677
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:34,999
Come on, let's play. Keep us warm.

1678
02:13:35,045 --> 02:13:36,872
''Orpheus''.

1679
02:13:37,089 --> 02:13:40,921
(playing fast music from
''Orpheus ln The Underworld'')

1680
02:13:40,968 --> 02:13:44,337
Music to drown by.
Now l know l'm in first class !

1681
02:13:49,518 --> 02:13:53,219
- Where is everyone ?
- They're all still aft, sir.

1682
02:13:55,190 --> 02:13:58,227
We have an understanding, then,
Mr Murdoch ?

1683
02:14:08,787 --> 02:14:10,863
(everyone shouting)

1684
02:14:11,999 --> 02:14:14,075
(gunshots)

1685
02:14:14,126 --> 02:14:17,376
Women and children only !

1686
02:14:17,421 --> 02:14:19,959
Get back ! Step back, sir.

1687
02:14:20,132 --> 02:14:23,168
Come through, madam.
This way. Step back, sir.

1688
02:14:23,219 --> 02:14:25,970
You better check the other side.

1689
02:14:26,013 --> 02:14:27,673
Go !

1690
02:14:29,433 --> 02:14:34,854
(Murdoch) Any more women
and children ? Any children ?

1691
02:14:34,897 --> 02:14:38,597
l found her on the other side
waiting for a boat.

1692
02:14:38,734 --> 02:14:40,145
With him.

1693
02:14:40,194 --> 02:14:43,894
- Any more women and children ?
- They're all aboard.

1694
02:14:43,948 --> 02:14:46,106
Anyone else, then !

1695
02:14:46,158 --> 02:14:49,112
- Anyone else !
- Hurry along.

1696
02:14:52,790 --> 02:14:54,829
Stand by the falls.

1697
02:14:54,875 --> 02:14:57,960
Oh, goddamn it all to hell !

1698
02:14:59,797 --> 02:15:01,256
Shit !

1699
02:15:01,298 --> 02:15:03,090
Fire !

1700
02:15:03,133 --> 02:15:05,885
Sir ! Sir, you can't go through here.

1701
02:15:05,928 --> 02:15:08,004
Sir, you can't go through.

1702
02:15:09,390 --> 02:15:12,011
Yes, yes, splendid. Right.

1703
02:15:13,102 --> 02:15:14,845
Right.

1704
02:15:15,354 --> 02:15:18,225
(Murdoch) Prepare to lower !

1705
02:15:20,276 --> 02:15:22,352
Ready on the left.

1706
02:15:27,199 --> 02:15:29,275
Take them down.

1707
02:15:33,664 --> 02:15:35,740
Keep it steady.

1708
02:15:37,084 --> 02:15:39,789
Both sides together. Steady...

1709
02:15:40,170 --> 02:15:42,412
Keep it steady.

1710
02:15:42,715 --> 02:15:44,209
Give her to me.

1711
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:45,462
Daddy...

1712
02:15:45,634 --> 02:15:49,086
lt'll be fine, darling.
Don't you worry.

1713
02:15:49,221 --> 02:15:52,721
lt's goodbye for a little while.
Only a little while.

1714
02:15:52,766 --> 02:15:57,594
There's another boat for daddies.
This one's for mummies and children.

1715
02:15:57,646 --> 02:16:00,316
Hold mummy's hand and be a good girl.

1716
02:16:00,357 --> 02:16:03,691
- l'm not going without you.
- You have to... Now !

1717
02:16:03,736 --> 02:16:04,767
No, Jack.

1718
02:16:04,820 --> 02:16:07,607
- Get in the boat, Rose.
- No, Jack.

1719
02:16:07,698 --> 02:16:09,572
Get on the boat !

1720
02:16:09,617 --> 02:16:12,072
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.

1721
02:16:14,246 --> 02:16:17,615
My God, look at you.
You look a fright !

1722
02:16:17,666 --> 02:16:19,291
Here.

1723
02:16:20,294 --> 02:16:22,168
Put this on.

1724
02:16:22,213 --> 02:16:23,837
Come.

1725
02:16:28,052 --> 02:16:32,132
- Go on. l'll get the next one.
- No ! Not without you !

1726
02:16:32,223 --> 02:16:36,434
l'll be fine. l'm a survivor, all right ?
Don't worry about me.

1727
02:16:36,477 --> 02:16:38,019
Now go on, get on.

1728
02:16:38,062 --> 02:16:41,976
l have an arrangement
with an officer on the ship.

1729
02:16:42,024 --> 02:16:44,396
Jack and l can get off safely.

1730
02:16:44,443 --> 02:16:45,606
See ?

1731
02:16:45,653 --> 02:16:48,654
- Got my own boat to catch.
- Hurry !

1732
02:16:48,697 --> 02:16:50,322
They're almost full.

1733
02:16:51,742 --> 02:16:53,818
Step aboard, miss.

1734
02:16:55,329 --> 02:16:57,618
Step aboard, please.

1735
02:16:57,706 --> 02:17:00,873
(Crewman)
Keep back. Keep back, l say !

1736
02:17:01,585 --> 02:17:03,661
Clear the row, please.

1737
02:17:05,381 --> 02:17:06,661
Lower away !

1738
02:17:10,135 --> 02:17:11,511
(Crewman) Slowly...

1739
02:17:11,762 --> 02:17:13,920
Keep going, keep going.

1740
02:17:14,223 --> 02:17:16,796
And lower away evenly, lads.

1741
02:17:16,934 --> 02:17:20,054
Easy... Lower away.

1742
02:17:20,104 --> 02:17:21,847
You're a good liar.

1743
02:17:21,897 --> 02:17:23,973
Almost as good as you.

1744
02:17:24,066 --> 02:17:27,517
(Crewman) Easy now... and lower away.

1745
02:17:28,696 --> 02:17:32,859
There's no, uh...
There's no arrangement, is there ?

1746
02:17:32,908 --> 02:17:35,067
No, there is.

1747
02:17:35,452 --> 02:17:38,157
Not that you'll benefit much from it.

1748
02:17:39,915 --> 02:17:41,991
l always win, Jack.

1749
02:17:42,126 --> 02:17:44,202
One way or another.

1750
02:17:46,714 --> 02:17:48,790
(Crewman) Easy...

1751
02:17:50,259 --> 02:17:52,252
Even, lads.

1752
02:17:52,344 --> 02:17:54,835
Keep going, keep going.

1753
02:18:42,478 --> 02:18:43,474

1754
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:45,727

You're so stupid ! Why'd you do that ?

1760
02:19:17,930 --> 02:19:20,006
You're so stupid, Rose !

1761
02:19:21,225 --> 02:19:23,514
Why did you do that ? Why ?

1762
02:19:23,936 --> 02:19:25,975
You jump, l jump, right ?

1763
02:19:27,022 --> 02:19:28,682
Right.

1764
02:19:30,943 --> 02:19:33,315
Oh, God, l couldn't go.

1765
02:19:33,362 --> 02:19:35,438
l couldn't go, Jack.

1766
02:19:35,489 --> 02:19:38,656
lt's all right.
We'll think of something.

1767
02:19:38,701 --> 02:19:41,073
(Rose) At least l'm with you.

1768
02:19:53,924 --> 02:19:55,122

(laughter)

1781
02:21:04,411 --> 02:21:06,902
What could possibly be funny ?

1782
02:21:08,082 --> 02:21:10,751

1783
02:21:12,586 --> 02:21:15,077

(child wailing)

1866
02:28:08,043 --> 02:28:09,953
There, there.

1867

Wait, wait, wait.

02:28:18,137 --> 02:28:19,596
Rose.

1870
02:28:21,223 --> 02:28:23,893
Won't you even make a try for it ?

1871
02:28:26,353 --> 02:28:31,348
l'm sorry that l didn't build you
a stronger ship, young Rose.

1872
02:28:31,567 --> 02:28:33,275
lt's going fast.

1873
02:28:33,319 --> 02:28:35,062
We have to move.

Wait.

1875
02:28:38,324 --> 02:28:40,400
Good luck to you, Rose.

1876
02:28:42,119 --> 02:28:43,946
And to you.

1877
02:28:55,132 --> 02:28:59,260
Mr Guggenheim...
These are for you, Mr Guggenheim.

1878

We are dressed in our best and

1880
02:29:05,392 --> 02:29:07,184
But we would like a brandy.

Goodbye, Wally. Good luck.

(starts playing
''Nearer My God To Thee'')

1890
02:31:24,198 --> 02:31:29,441
And so they lived happily together

1891
02:31:29,495 --> 02:31:32,496
..in the land of Tir Na Nog.

1892
02:31:32,540 --> 02:31:35,743
Land of eternal youth and beauty.

1893
02:32:09,827 --> 02:32:12,234
There's no time !

Gentlemen, it has been a privilege

We have to stay on the ship

02:35:48,295 --> 02:35:49,837
(metal groaning)

1911
02:36:09,024 --> 02:36:11,100
No ! You'll swamp us !

1912
02:36:14,947 --> 02:36:17,319
(screaming)

1913
02:36:23,831 --> 02:36:27,034
Though l walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

1914

You wanna walk a little faster

1918
02:37:19,386 --> 02:37:21,960
Holy Mary, Mother of God,...

1919
02:37:22,014 --> 02:37:25,715
..pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death. Amen.

1920
02:37:25,768 --> 02:37:27,262
Hail Mary, full of grace...

1921

1923
02:37:38,948 --> 02:37:40,821
Come on !

1924
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,207
l saw a new heaven and a new earth...

1925
02:37:52,253 --> 02:37:56,546
..when the first heaven and
the first earth had passed away...

1926
02:37:56,590 --> 02:37:58,915
..and there was no more sea.

1927
02:38:04,723 --> 02:38:09,017
lt'll be over soon.
lt'll all be over soon.

1928
02:38:13,440 --> 02:38:17,485
And he shall dwell with them
and they shall be his people...

1929
02:38:17,528 --> 02:38:20,233
..and God himself shall be with them.

1930
02:38:22,616 --> 02:38:24,525
Jack,...

1931
02:38:24,577 --> 02:38:27,494
..this is where we first met.

1932
02:38:33,711 --> 02:38:37,293
And God shall wipe away
all the tears from their eyes.

1933
02:38:37,339 --> 02:38:39,462
And there shall be no more death.

1934
02:38:39,508 --> 02:38:42,545
Neither shall there be sorrow or crying.

1935
02:38:42,595 --> 02:38:46,129
Neither shall there be
any more pain...

1936
02:38:46,181 --> 02:38:49,467
..for the former world has passed away.

1937
02:39:03,240 --> 02:39:05,778
Bloody pull faster, and pull !

1938
02:39:08,996 --> 02:39:11,072

The boats are coming back for us, Rose.
Hold on just a bit longer.

2012
02:47:34,752 --> 02:47:38,203
They... had to row away
from the suction...

2013
02:47:38,255 --> 02:47:40,925
..but... now they'll be coming back.

2014
02:47:40,966 --> 02:47:43,884
(Woman) Come back !

2015
02:47:43,928 --> 02:47:48,554

2016
02:47:48,599 --> 02:47:50,390
(faint cries in distance)

2017
02:47:50,434 --> 02:47:53,055
Come back ! For God's sake !

2018
02:47:53,145 --> 02:47:58,650
You don't understand. lf we go back,
they'll swamp the boat !

2019
02:47:58,692 --> 02:48:03,153
- They'll pull us right down !
- Knock it off. You're scaring me.

2020
02:48:03,197 --> 02:48:05,522
Come on, girls, grab an oar.

2021
02:48:05,574 --> 02:48:09,442
Are you mad ?! We're in the middle
of the North Atlantic !

2022
02:48:09,495 --> 02:48:13,362
Do you people want to live
or do you want to die !

2023
02:48:19,713 --> 02:48:22,418
l don't understand a one of you.

2024
02:48:23,676 --> 02:48:26,083
What's the matter with you ?!

2025
02:48:26,136 --> 02:48:28,627
lt's your men out there !

2026
02:48:28,681 --> 02:48:33,639
- There's plenty of room for more.

2027
02:48:33,686 --> 02:48:37,351
..if you don't shut that hole
in your face !

2028
02:48:37,439 --> 02:48:40,939
(woman in distance) Come back !

2029
02:48:51,203 --> 02:48:52,863
Take this one.

2030
02:48:52,913 --> 02:48:57,908
Bring in your oars over there.
Tie these two boats together as well.

2031
02:49:01,338 --> 02:49:04,957
Now make sure that's tied up
nice and tight.

2032
02:49:07,428 --> 02:49:10,429
Listen to me, men,
we have to go back.

2033
02:49:10,472 --> 02:49:15,715
l want to transfer all the women
from this boat into that boat.

2034
02:49:15,769 --> 02:49:18,225
Let's get some space there.

2035
02:49:19,690 --> 02:49:22,181
(distant moaning)

2036
02:49:25,237 --> 02:49:27,562
(shivering)

2037
02:49:27,615 --> 02:49:30,284
lt's getting quiet.

2038
02:49:31,493 --> 02:49:35,408
lt's just gonna take 'em
a couple of minutes to get...

2039
02:49:35,456 --> 02:49:37,911
..the boats organised.

2040
02:49:40,211 --> 02:49:42,748
l don't know about you, but...

2041
02:49:42,796 --> 02:49:48,004
..l intend to write a strongly worded letter
to the White Star Line...

2042
02:49:48,052 --> 02:49:50,128
..about all this.

2043
02:49:50,804 --> 02:49:53,924
(distant moans and cries for help)

2044
02:49:56,060 --> 02:49:58,348
l love you, Jack.

2045
02:50:04,610 --> 02:50:06,686
Don't you do that.

2046
02:50:07,738 --> 02:50:10,941
Don't you say your goodbyes. Not yet.

2047
02:50:11,033 --> 02:50:13,073
Do you understand me ?

2048
02:50:13,285 --> 02:50:15,361
l'm so cold.

2049
02:50:15,412 --> 02:50:17,370
Listen, Rose...

2050
02:50:17,414 --> 02:50:20,250
You're gonna get out of here.

2051
02:50:20,292 --> 02:50:25,583
You're gonna go on, and you're
gonna make lots of babies,...

2052
02:50:25,631 --> 02:50:29,000
..and you're gonna watch 'em grow.

2053
02:50:29,051 --> 02:50:31,127
You're gonna die an old...

2054
02:50:31,178 --> 02:50:34,512
..an old lady warm in her bed.

2055
02:50:35,224 --> 02:50:37,300
Not here.

2056
02:50:37,351 --> 02:50:40,850
Not this night. Not like this.

2057
02:50:40,896 --> 02:50:43,221
Do you understand me ?

2058
02:50:45,734 --> 02:50:47,941
l can't feel my body.

2059
02:50:49,238 --> 02:50:54,908
Winning that ticket was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

2060
02:50:55,286 --> 02:50:57,362
lt brought me to you...

2061
02:50:58,414 --> 02:51:01,284
..and l'm thankful for that, Rose.

2062
02:51:01,333 --> 02:51:03,409
l'm thankful.

2063
02:51:04,670 --> 02:51:07,457
You must... You must...

2064
02:51:09,049 --> 02:51:11,719
You must do me this honour...

2065
02:51:13,429 --> 02:51:17,343
You must promise me
that you'll survive,...

2066
02:51:19,393 --> 02:51:21,931
..that you won't give up,...

2067
02:51:21,979 --> 02:51:24,387
..no matter what happens,...

2068
02:51:26,775 --> 02:51:29,266
..no matter how hopeless.

2069
02:51:32,489 --> 02:51:34,565
Promise me now, Rose,...

2070
02:51:36,577 --> 02:51:39,494
..and never let go of that promise.

2071
02:51:40,372 --> 02:51:42,448
l promise.

2072
02:51:44,126 --> 02:51:46,202
Never let go.

2073
02:51:48,672 --> 02:51:50,961
l will never let go, Jack.

2074
02:51:53,469 --> 02:51:56,304
l'll never let go.

2075
02:52:18,702 --> 02:52:21,028
(Crewman) Right ahead, sir.

2076
02:52:23,874 --> 02:52:25,950
(Lowe) Oars !

2077
02:52:26,001 --> 02:52:28,327
Do you see any moving ?

2078
02:52:28,379 --> 02:52:30,667
No, sir. None moving, sir.

2079
02:52:30,714 --> 02:52:32,790
Check them.

2080
02:52:33,384 --> 02:52:35,460
Bring that oar up here.

2081
02:52:39,640 --> 02:52:41,716
Check them. Make sure.

2082
02:52:43,310 --> 02:52:45,386
These are dead, sir.

2083
02:52:45,437 --> 02:52:47,097
Now give way.

2084
02:52:47,147 --> 02:52:49,021
Ahead easy.

2085
02:52:54,655 --> 02:52:57,027
Careful with your oars.

2086
02:52:57,074 --> 02:52:59,150
Don't hit them.

2087
02:53:00,578 --> 02:53:03,578
ls there anyone alive out there !

2088
02:53:04,123 --> 02:53:07,243

ls there anyone alive out there !

2090
02:53:17,428 --> 02:53:19,504
We waited too long.

(Rose singing softly)

2095
02:53:55,633 --> 02:53:59,049
#And it's up she goes.

2096
02:53:59,094 --> 02:54:01,467
# Up she goes.

2097
02:54:08,145 --> 02:54:11,514
(continues singing)

2098
02:54:29,416 --> 02:54:33,628
(Lowe's voice, garbled and slow)

2099
02:54:39,051 --> 02:54:40,676
Jack ?

2100
02:54:44,765 --> 02:54:46,805
Jack.

2101
02:54:49,436 --> 02:54:51,762
Jack.

2102
02:54:58,279 --> 02:55:01,315
Jack... there's a boat.

2103
02:55:02,116 --> 02:55:03,989
Jack...

2104
02:55:14,545 --> 02:55:16,336
Jack ?

2105
02:55:16,755 --> 02:55:18,713
Jack...

2106
02:55:19,758 --> 02:55:21,834
Jack !

2107
02:55:24,555 --> 02:55:26,631
Jack !

2108
02:55:28,434 --> 02:55:31,185
There's a boat, Jack.

2109
02:55:33,355 --> 02:55:35,431
Jack ?

2110
02:56:14,230 --> 02:56:16,306
Come back.

2111
02:56:16,607 --> 02:56:18,350
Come back !

2112
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:20,310
(voices of searchers)

2113
02:56:20,361 --> 02:56:22,437
Come back !

2114
02:56:22,947 --> 02:56:24,571
Come back !

2115
02:56:24,615 --> 02:56:26,691
Come back !

2116
02:56:27,618 --> 02:56:30,026
Come back ! Come back !

2117
02:56:31,330 --> 02:56:33,239
Hello !

2118
02:56:34,625 --> 02:56:37,294
Can anyone hear me !

2119
02:56:37,378 --> 02:56:39,951
There's nothing here, sir.

2120
02:56:41,507 --> 02:56:43,583
Come back !

2121
02:56:44,343 --> 02:56:46,419
Come back...

2122
02:56:53,102 --> 02:56:55,178
l'll never let go.

2123
02:56:55,229 --> 02:56:57,305
l promise.

2124
02:57:36,103 --> 02:57:38,511
(whistling)

2125
02:57:39,356 --> 02:57:41,432
Come about !

2126
02:58:02,963 --> 02:58:09,880
1,500 people went into the sea
when Titanic sank from under us.

2127
02:58:11,805 --> 02:58:15,755
There were 20 boats
floating nearby...

2128
02:58:16,227 --> 02:58:18,800
..and only one came back.

2129
02:58:19,647 --> 02:58:21,473
One.

2130
02:58:23,192 --> 02:58:26,109
Six were saved from the water,...

2131
02:58:26,153 --> 02:58:28,359
..myself included.

2132
02:58:29,114 --> 02:58:34,156
Six... out of 1,500.

2133
02:58:36,830 --> 02:58:38,906
Afterward,..

2134
02:58:39,458 --> 02:58:44,369
..the 700 people in the boats
had nothing to do but wait.

2135
02:58:46,131 --> 02:58:49,666
Wait to die, wait to live...

2136
02:58:50,719 --> 02:58:53,008
Wait for an absolution...

2137
02:58:53,055 --> 02:58:55,131
..that would never come.

2138
02:59:57,661 --> 03:00:02,122
Sir, l don't think you'll find
any of your people down here.

2139
03:00:02,166 --> 03:00:04,242
lt's all steerage.

2140
03:00:05,544 --> 03:00:10,336
(Woman) His hair is reddish brown.
Reddish brown and a white beard.

2141
03:00:10,382 --> 03:00:14,510
- ls there another passenger list ?
- There's no other list.

2142
03:00:14,553 --> 03:00:19,014
- Perhaps he's on another ship.
- We're doing all we can, ma'am.

2143
03:00:41,455 --> 03:00:44,373
(Rose)
{y:i}That's the last time l ever saw him.

2144
03:00:44,416 --> 03:00:48,496
{y:i}He married, of course,
{y:i}and inherited his millions.

2145
03:00:48,546 --> 03:00:52,045
{y:i}But the crash of '29
{y:i}hit his interests hard...

2146
03:00:52,091 --> 03:00:55,424
{y:i}..and he put a pistol
{y:i}in his mouth that year.

2147
03:00:55,469 --> 03:00:58,304
Or so l read.

2148
03:01:09,650 --> 03:01:12,058
Can l take your name, please, love ?

2149
03:01:15,239 --> 03:01:17,315
Dawson.

2150
03:01:18,617 --> 03:01:20,740
Rose Dawson.

2151
03:01:20,786 --> 03:01:22,862
Thank you.

2152
03:01:29,044 --> 03:01:33,790
We never found anything on Jack.
There's no record of him at all.

2153
03:01:33,841 --> 03:01:36,758
No, there wouldn't be, would there ?

2154
03:01:37,094 --> 03:01:40,510
And l've never spoken of him until now.

2155
03:01:40,556 --> 03:01:42,632
Not to anyone.

2156
03:01:42,683 --> 03:01:45,304
Not even your grandfather.

2157
03:01:45,352 --> 03:01:49,101
A woman's heart
is a deep ocean of secrets.

2158
03:01:49,607 --> 03:01:53,854
But now you know there was
a man named Jack Dawson...

2159
03:01:53,903 --> 03:01:56,025
..and that he saved me.

2160
03:01:56,071 --> 03:01:59,772
ln every way that a person can be saved.

2161
03:02:01,535 --> 03:02:04,287
l don't even have a picture of him.

2162
03:02:06,790 --> 03:02:10,539
He exists now only in my memory.

2163
03:02:15,257 --> 03:02:19,635
(Man) Keldysh, Keldysh,
Mir 2 on our way to the surface.

2164
03:02:34,777 --> 03:02:38,276
(Brock) l was saving this
for when l found the diamond.

2165
03:02:47,581 --> 03:02:49,657
l'm sorry.

2166
03:02:52,002 --> 03:02:56,581
Three years l've thought
of nothing except Titanic...

2167
03:02:57,550 --> 03:02:59,626
..but l never got it.

2168
03:03:02,388 --> 03:03:04,795
l never let it in.

2169
03:07:38,706 --> 03:07:43,083
# Every night in my dreams...

2170
03:07:43,294 --> 03:07:45,251
# ..l see you,...

2171
03:07:45,796 --> 03:07:48,085
# ..l feel you...

2172
03:07:48,716 --> 03:07:57,221
# That is how l know you go on.

2173
03:07:58,309 --> 03:08:02,258
# Far across the distance...

2174
03:08:02,897 --> 03:08:07,642
#And spaces between us...

2175
03:08:08,319 --> 03:08:15,282
# You have come to show you go on.

2176
03:08:17,494 --> 03:08:19,119
# Near...

2177
03:08:20,206 --> 03:08:21,830
# Far...

2178
03:08:22,082 --> 03:08:25,748
#Wherever you are...

2179
03:08:26,462 --> 03:08:35,964
# l believe that the heart does go on.

2180
03:08:37,306 --> 03:08:41,007
# Once more...

2181
03:08:41,477 --> 03:08:45,012
# ..you open the door...

2182
03:08:45,731 --> 03:08:49,729
# ..and you're here in my heart,...

2183
03:08:50,027 --> 03:08:57,358
# ..and my heart will go on and on.

2184
03:08:59,119 --> 03:09:02,738
# Love can touch just one time...

2185
03:09:03,541 --> 03:09:08,333
# ..and last for a lifetime...

2186
03:09:09,004 --> 03:09:14,509
# ..and never let go till we're gone.

2187
03:09:18,597 --> 03:09:21,931
# Love was when l loved you...

2188
03:09:22,977 --> 03:09:27,769
# One true time l hold to...

2189
03:09:28,399 --> 03:09:36,904
# ln my life we'll always go on.

2190
03:09:37,700 --> 03:09:39,360
# Near...

2191
03:09:39,952 --> 03:09:41,612
# Far...

2192
03:09:41,954 --> 03:09:45,786
#Wherever you are...

2193
03:09:46,208 --> 03:09:56,173
# l believe that the heart does go on.

2194
03:09:57,386 --> 03:10:00,921
# Once more...

2195
03:10:01,557 --> 03:10:05,507
# ..you open the door...

2196
03:10:05,936 --> 03:10:09,934
# ..and you're here in my heart,...

2197
03:10:10,274 --> 03:10:19,361
# ..and my heart will go on and on.

2198
03:10:36,258 --> 03:10:39,923
# You're here...

2199
03:10:40,679 --> 03:10:44,131
# There's nothing l fear...

2200
03:10:45,017 --> 03:10:53,855
#And l know that my heart will go on.

2201
03:10:56,320 --> 03:10:59,819
#We'll stay...

2202
03:11:00,241 --> 03:11:04,653
# ..forever this way...

2203
03:11:05,037 --> 03:11:09,117
# You are safe in my heart...

2204
03:11:09,458 --> 03:11:20,337
# ..and my heart will go on and on.
